Assume you earn Rs.50,000/- per month, and you spend Rs.30,000/-towards your day-to-day living; this can include expenses like housing, food, transport, shopping, medical, etc. The balance of Rs.20,000/- is your monthly surplus.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch1-title1.jpg\"><img alt=\"Ch 1 Need to Invest\" class=\"wp-image-125 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch1-title1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch1-title1.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch1-title1-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For the sake of simplicity, let us ignore the tax effect in this discussion.</p>\n<p>To drive the point across, let us make a few simple assumptions –</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>The employer is kind enough to give you a 10% salary hike every year.</li>\n<li>The cost of living is likely to go up by 8% yearly.</li>\n<li>You are 30 years old and plan to retire at 50, this translates to 20 working years.</li>\n<li>You don’t intend to work after you retire.</li>\n<li>Your expenses are fixed, and you don’t foresee any other expenses.</li>\n<li> The balance cash of Rs.20,000/- per month is retained as hard cash.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Going by these assumptions, here is what the cash balance will look like in 20 years.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Years</th>\n<th>Yearly Income</th>\n<th>Yearly Expense</th>\n<th>Cash Retained</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>600,000</td>\n<td>360,000</td>\n<td>240,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>6,60,000</td>\n<td>3,88,800</td>\n<td>2,71,200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>7,26,000</td>\n<td>4,19,904</td>\n<td>3,06,096</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>7,98,600</td>\n<td>4,53,496</td>\n<td>3,45,104</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>8,78,460</td>\n<td>4,89,776</td>\n<td>3,88,684</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>9,66,306</td>\n<td>5,28,958</td>\n<td>4,37,348</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>10,62,937</td>\n<td>5,71,275</td>\n<td>4,91,662</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>11,69,230</td>\n<td>6,16,977</td>\n<td>5,52,254</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>12,86,153</td>\n<td>6,66,335</td>\n<td>6,19,818</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>14,14,769</td>\n<td>7,19,642</td>\n<td>6,95,127</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>15,56,245</td>\n<td>7,77,213</td>\n<td>7,79,032</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>17,11,870</td>\n<td>8,39,390</td>\n<td>8,72,480</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>18,83,057</td>\n<td>9,06,541</td>\n<td>9,76,516</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>20,71,363</td>\n<td>9,79,065</td>\n<td>10,92,298</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>22,78,499</td>\n<td>10,57,390</td>\n<td>12,21,109</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>25,06,349</td>\n<td>11,41,981</td>\n<td>13,64,368</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>27,56,984</td>\n<td>12,33,339</td>\n<td>15,23,644</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>30,32,682</td>\n<td>13,32,006</td>\n<td>17,00,676</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>33,35,950</td>\n<td>14,38,567</td>\n<td>18,97,383</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>36,69,545</td>\n<td><strong>15,53,652 </strong></td>\n<td>21,15,893</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Total Income</strong></th>\n<th><strong>17,890,693</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If one were to analyze these numbers, one would soon realize this is a scary situation. A few things are quite obvious –</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>After 20 years of hard work, you have accumulated Rs.1.7Crs.</li>\n<li>Since your expenses are fixed, your lifestyle has not changed over the years, and you probably even suppressed your lifelong aspirations – a better home, car, vacations, etc.</li>\n<li>After you retire, assuming the expenses will continue to grow at 8%, the retirement corpus of Rs.1.7Crs is good enough to sail you through roughly 8 years of post-retirement life. 8th year onwards, you will be in a tight spot with literally no savings left to back you up.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What would you do after you run out of money in 8 years? How do you fund your life? Is there a way to ensure that you collect a more considerable sum at the end of 20 years?</p>\n<p>At this point, you may think that the assumptions are simple and that real life does not work like this. I agree, and I won’t dispute that fact. However, the point to note in the above calculation is that no investments are made, hence the cash retained has a flat or zero growth.</p>\n<p>Let’s consider another scenario where instead of keeping the cash idle, you choose to invest the cash in an investment option that grows at, let’s say, 12% per annum. For example – in the first year, you retained Rs.240,000/- which, when invested at 12% per annum for 20 years (19 years assuming you invest at the end of 1st year), yields Rs.2,067,063/- at the end of the 20th year. For those interested in math, here is how that works –</p>\n<p>= 240000*(1+12%)^(19)</p>\n<p>= <strong>2067063</strong></p>\n<p>Dont worry about the math at this point. We will explain that later in this module (and several other modules in Varsity). Here is how the table looks if you choose to invest.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Years</th>\n<th>Yearly Income</th>\n<th>Yearly Expense</th>\n<th>Cash Retained</th>\n<th>Retained Cash Invested @12%</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>600,000</td>\n<td>360,000</td>\n<td>240,000</td>\n<td> 20,67,063</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>6,60,000</td>\n<td>3,88,800</td>\n<td>2,71,200</td>\n<td> 20,85,519</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>7,26,000</td>\n<td>4,19,904</td>\n<td>3,06,096</td>\n<td> 21,01,668</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>7,98,600</td>\n<td>4,53,496</td>\n<td>3,45,104</td>\n<td> 21,15,621</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>8,78,460</td>\n<td>4,89,776</td>\n<td>3,88,684</td>\n<td> 21,27,487</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>9,66,306</td>\n<td>5,28,958</td>\n<td>4,37,348</td>\n<td> 21,37,368</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>10,62,937</td>\n<td>5,71,275</td>\n<td>4,91,662</td>\n<td> 21,45,363</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>11,69,230</td>\n<td>6,16,977</td>\n<td>5,52,254</td>\n<td> 21,51,566</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>12,86,153</td>\n<td>6,66,335</td>\n<td>6,19,818</td>\n<td> 21,56,069</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>14,14,769</td>\n<td>7,19,642</td>\n<td>6,95,127</td>\n<td> 21,58,959</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>15,56,245</td>\n<td>7,77,213</td>\n<td>7,79,032</td>\n<td> 21,60,318</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>17,11,870</td>\n<td>8,39,390</td>\n<td>8,72,480</td>\n<td> 21,60,228</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>18,83,057</td>\n<td>9,06,541</td>\n<td>9,76,516</td>\n<td> 21,58,765</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>20,71,363</td>\n<td>9,79,065</td>\n<td>10,92,298</td>\n<td> 21,56,003</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>22,78,499</td>\n<td>10,57,390</td>\n<td>12,21,109</td>\n<td> 21,52,012</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>25,06,349</td>\n<td>11,41,981</td>\n<td>13,64,368</td>\n<td> 21,46,859</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>27,56,984</td>\n<td>12,33,339</td>\n<td>15,23,644</td>\n<td> 21,40,611</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>30,32,682</td>\n<td>13,32,006</td>\n<td>17,00,676</td>\n<td> 21,33,328</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>33,35,950</td>\n<td>14,38,567</td>\n<td>18,97,383</td>\n<td> 21,25,069</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>36,69,545</td>\n<td><strong>15,53,652 </strong></td>\n<td>21,15,893</td>\n<td> 21,15,893</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong>Total cash after 20 years</strong></th>\n<th> <strong>4,26,95,771 </strong></th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Your cash balance has increased significantly with the decision to invest surplus cash. The cash balance has grown to Rs.4.26Crs from Rs.1.7Crs,  a staggering 2.4x more than earlier (when you choose not to invest). Clearly, with the decision to invest, you are in a much better situation to deal with your post-retirement life.</p>\n<p>Now, going back to the initial question of why invest? There are a few compelling reasons –</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Fight Inflation</strong> – By investing, one can deal better with the inevitable reality of life – the growing cost of living – generally referred to as Inflation.</li>\n<li><strong>Create Wealth</strong> – By investing, one can build a bigger corpus by the end of the target period. In the above example, the period was up to retirement, but it can be anything – children’s education, marriage, house purchase, retirement holidays, etc</li>\n<li><strong>Better life</strong> – To meet life’s financial aspirations.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>1.2 – Where to invest?</h2>\n<p>Having figured out the reasons to invest, the next obvious question is – where would one invest, and what return can one expect with investing? When investing, one has to choose an <strong>asset class</strong> that suits the individual’s risk and returns profile. For example, one individual will be open to taking a lot of risk with his or her money, while another may want to take moderate risk, while another would want zero risk.</p>\n<p>Think of an asset class as an investment vehicle defined by its risk and return characteristics.  The following are some of the popular asset classes.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Fixed income instruments</li>\n<li>Equity</li>\n<li>Real estate</li>\n<li>Commodities (precious metals)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><a><img alt=\"fixed-inst-icon\" class=\"sub-img alignleft wp-image-163 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/fixed-inst-icon.png\" width=\"131\"/> </a>Fixed Income Instruments</h3>\n<p>Fixed-income instruments are investment avenues where your principal amount (the money you invest) is perceived to be safe. The entity pays an interest amount on the principal you invest. The bank’s fixed deposit scheme is the simplest example of a fixed investment instrument.  The interest paid could be quarterly, semi-annual or annual. The capital is returned to the investor at the end of the investment period, also known as the maturity period.</p>\n<p>A few examples for fixed-income instruments are –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bank’s Fixed deposits</li>\n<li>Bonds issued by the Government of India (also called G Sec bonds and T Bills)</li>\n<li>Bonds issued by Government related agencies such as GAIL, HUDCO, NHAI, etc</li>\n<li>Bonds issued by corporate’s (Tata, Bajaj, Reliance, Adani)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As of October 2022, the typical return from a fixed-income instrument (bank’s FD) varies between 5 – 6%. Government bonds offer about 5.5%, and a few corporate bonds offer nearly 9 or 10%. The rates across different instruments vary because of the risk varies. The Govt bonds are considered the safest investment, with zero risk to your investment, because, well, the govt can’t cheat and run away with your money. Corporate bonds are risky, though; investment in corporate bonds can go to zero, and we have seen plenty of such examples in the past.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/equity.png\"> </a><img alt=\"equity-icon1\" class=\"sub-img alignleft wp-image-164 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/equity-icon1.png\" width=\"131\"/>Equity</h3>\n<p>Investment in Equities involves buying shares of publicly listed companies. The shares are traded on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE).</p>\n<p>When an investor invests in equity, unlike a fixed-income instrument, there is no capital guarantee. However, as a trade-off, the returns from equity investment can be much better. Indian Equities have generated upwards of 12% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over the past 10 to 15 years.</p>\n<p>Investing in some of the best and most well-run Indian companies has yielded over 20% CAGR in the long term. Identifying such investment opportunities requires skill, hard work, and patience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3><img alt=\"real-estate-icon\" class=\"sub-img alignleft wp-image-161 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/real-estate-icon.png\" width=\"131\"/></h3>\n<h3>Real Estate</h3>\n<p>Real Estate Investment involves transacting (buying and selling) commercial and non-commercial land. Typical examples include transacting in vacant plots, apartments, and commercial buildings. There are two income sources from real estate investments: Rental income and Capital appreciation of the investment amount. The rental yield typically varies between 2-3%, which is not so attractive, in my opinion. The appreciation in land prices is in select pockets and is not uniform.</p>\n<p>The transaction procedure can be quite complex involving legal verification of documents. The cash outlay in real estate investment is usually quite large. There is no official metric to measure the returns generated by real estate. Hence it would be hard to comment on this.</p>\n<h3><img alt=\"commodity-icon\" class=\"sub-img alignleft wp-image-162 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/commodity-icon.png\" width=\"131\"/></h3>\n<h3>Commodity – Bullion</h3>\n<p>Gold and silver are considered one of the most popular investment options.  Gold and silver, over the long term, have appreciated. Investments in these metals have yielded a CAGR return of approximately 5-8% over the last 20 years. There are several ways to invest in gold and silver. One can invest in jewelry, Exchange Traded Funds (ETF), or <a href=\"https://tradingqna.com/t/what-are-sovereign-gold-bonds/6372\">Sovereign Gold bonds</a>, popularly called as SGBs.</p>\n<p>Going back to our initial example of investing the surplus cash, it would be interesting to see how much one would have saved by the end of 20 years, considering he can invest in any one – fixed income, equity, or bullion.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>By investing in fixed income at an average rate of 9% per annum (good corporate bond), the corpus would have grown to Rs.3.3Crs.</li>\n<li>Investing in equities at an average rate of 15% per annum, the corpus would have grown to Rs.5.4Crs.</li>\n<li>Investing in bullion at an average rate of 8% per annum, the corpus would have grown to Rs.3.09Crs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Equities tend to give you the best returns, especially when you have a multi-year investment perspective.</p>\n<p>Many of you reading this may wonder why I’ve not considered Cryptocurrencies as an asset class. When you invest your hard-earned money, you need to ensure enough checks, balances, and regulatory frameworks to protect you as an investor. Crypto, lacks all these; hence I’d suggest you stay away from crypto (or any other fancy investment option) till there is a regulatory framework.</p>\n<p>It is best if your investments have a mix of all asset classes. It is wise to diversify your investment among the various asset classes. The technique of allocating money across asset classes is termed ‘Asset Allocation’, and we will discuss asset allocation later in Varsity.</p>\n<p>For instance, a young professional may take a higher risk given the age and years of investment available. Typically investors should allocate at least 60% of their investable amount in equity, 20% in precious metals, and 20% in fixed-income investments. The percentage mix changes based on risk profile and age. For example, a retired person could invest 80% in fixed income (Govt bonds maybe), 10% in equity markets, and 10% in precious metals.</p>\n<h2>1.3 – Things to note before investing</h2>\n<p>Investing is an integral part of financial planning, but before you start your investment journey, it is good to be aware of the following –</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Risk and Return go hand in hand. Higher the risk, the higher the return. The lower the risk, the lower the return.</li>\n<li>Investment in fixed income is a good option if you want to protect your principal amount. It is relatively less risky. However, you have the risk of losing money when you adjust the inflation return. Example – A fixed deposit that gives you 9% when the inflation is 10% means you lose a net of 1% per annum. Alternatively, the risk increases if you invest in a corporate fixed-income instrument.</li>\n<li>Investment in Equities is a great option. It is known to beat inflation over a long period. Historically equity investment has generated returns close to 14-15%. However, equity investments can be risky.</li>\n<li>Real Estate investment requires a significant outlay of cash and cannot be done with smaller amounts. Liquidity is another issue with real estate investment – you cannot buy or sell whenever you want.</li>\n<li>Gold and silver are relatively safer, but the historical return on such investment has not been very encouraging.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can download the <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Module-1_Chapter-1_savings-comparision.xlsx\">excel sheet</a> used in the chapter to generate the two tables.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>One has to invest, to secure his or her’s financial future.</li>\n<li>The corpus you build at the end of the investment period is sensitive to the return percentage. A slight variation in the rate can significantly impact the corpus.</li>\n<li>Choose an instrument that best suits your risk and return appetite.</li>\n<li>Equity should be a part of your investment if you want to beat inflation in the long run.</li>\n<li>A good investment practice is to build a portfolio that mixes all asset classes.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>2.1 – What is the stock market?</h2>\n<p>In the previous chapter, we established that investing in equities is vital to generate inflation-beating returns. Having said that, how do we go about investing in equities? Before we dwell further into this topic, it is essential to understand the market ecosystem and the many different entities involved in making our capital market journey smooth.</p>\n<p>Just like the way we go to the neighborhood kirana store or a supermarket to shop for our daily needs, similarly, we go to the stock market to shop (read as transact) for investments. The stock market is where all the participants who wish to transact in shares go. Transact means to buy or sell shares in the context of stock markets. The primary purpose of the stock market is to help you facilitate your transactions. So if you want to buy shares of a company, the stock market helps you meet the seller and vice versa.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch2-title.jpg\"><img alt=\"Ch2-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-143\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch2-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch2-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch2-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>Unlike a supermarket, the stock market does not exist in a brick-and-mortar form. It exists in electronic form. You access the market electronically from your computer and conduct transactions (buy or sell). It is also important to note that you can access the stock market via a registered intermediary called the stockbroker. We will discuss the stockbrokers at a later point.</p>\n<p>India has two stock exchanges – the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE). There were many other exchanges earlier, but none of them survived. So when you talk about the stock markets in India, you are essentially referring to either NSE or BSE. Older stock exchanges like Bangalore Stock Exchange (BgSE), Madras Stock Exchange (MSE), Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) have either merged with BSE/NSE or shut shop.</p>\n<h2>2.2 – Market Participants and the need to regulate them</h2>\n<p>The stock market attracts individuals and corporations from diverse backgrounds. Anyone who transacts in the stock market is called a market participant. The market participant can be classified into various categories –</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Domestic Retail Participants</strong> – These are people like you and me transacting in markets</li>\n<li><strong>NRI’s and OCI</strong> – These are people of Indian origin but based outside India</li>\n<li><strong>Domestic Institutions</strong> – These are corporate entities in India</li>\n<li><strong>Domestic Asset Management Companies (AMC)</strong> – Mutual fund companies like SBI Mutual Fund, HDFC AMC, Edelweiss, ICICI Pru, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Foreign Institutional Investors</strong> – Non-Indian corporate entities. These could be foreign asset management companies, hedge funds, and other investors.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, irrespective of who participates in the market, the agenda for all is to make profitable transactions. More bluntly put – to make money.</p>\n<p>When money is involved, human emotions such as greed and fear run high. One can easily fall prey to these emotions and get involved in unfair practices. India has its fair share of such unethical practices. Given this, the stock markets need someone who can set the game rules (commonly referred to as regulation and compliance) and ensure that people adhere to these regulations and compliance, thereby making the markets a level playing field for everyone.</p>\n<h2>2.3 – The Regulator</h2>\n<p>In India, the stock market regulator is called <strong>The Securities and Exchange Board of India,</strong> often referred to as SEBI. SEBI aims to promote the development of stock exchanges, protect the interest of retail investors, and regulate market participants’ and financial intermediaries’ activities. In general, SEBI ensures:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>The stock exchange conducts its business fairly</li>\n<li>Stockbrokers conduct their business fairly</li>\n<li>Participants don’t get involved in unfair practices</li>\n<li>Corporates don’t use the markets to benefit themselves (Satyam Computers) unduly</li>\n<li>Small investors’ interests are protected</li>\n<li>Large investors with mega cash piles should not manipulate the markets</li>\n<li>Overall development of markets</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given the above objectives, it becomes imperative for SEBI to regulate all the entities which are involved in the market. All the entities mentioned below are directly involved in the stock markets.

Right from the time you log in to a trading terminal (let’s say to buy shares), to the time these shares hit your DEMAT account, market intermediaries work seamlessly together to ensure your transactions flow without any hiccups.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch3-title.jpg\"><img alt=\"Ch3-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-170\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch3-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch3-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch3-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></h2>\n<p>These entities play their role quietly behind the scene, always complying with the rules laid out by SEBI and ensuring an effortless and smooth experience for your transactions in the stock market. These entities are generally referred to as Financial Intermediaries or market intermediaries.</p>\n<p>Together, these financial intermediaries, interdependent on one another, create an ecosystem in which the financial markets operate. Let us quickly review a few of these key market intermediaries and the roles they play in the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/broker3.png\"><img alt=\"broker3\" class=\"sub-heading-img alignnone wp-image-191 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"48\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/broker3.png\" width=\"48\"/></a> 3.2 – The Stock Broker</h2>\n<p>The stockbroker is probably one of the most important financial intermediaries you need to know. A stockbroker is a corporate entity registered as a trading member with the stock exchange and holds a stockbroking license. SEBI grants the license through due diligence, and the broker is expected to comply with the rules prescribed by SEBI.</p>\n<p>A stockbroker is your gateway to the stock markets to make investments in stocks, bonds, ETFs, and Mutual funds. To transact in the stock market, you must set up (open account) with a stockbroker of your choice. Many stock brokers are registered in India, and you can choose a broker based on personal criteria. A few popular filters based on which people select stockbrokers are –</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>The simplicity of the broker platform</li>\n<li>The efficiency of the broker’s support system</li>\n<li>Access to ready reports – Profit &amp; Loss reports, Tradebook, Tax P&amp;L</li>\n<li>Broker’s net worth (you dont want to deal with a broker who is not profitable or does not have a good P&amp;L)</li>\n<li>Initiatives like education</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you decide on your broker and open a trading and DEMAT account, you can start transacting in the stock market. After setting up your account, there are a few standard ways to interact with your broker.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>You can call your broker, identify yourself with your client code (account code) and place an order for your transaction. The dealer at the other end will execute the order for you and confirm the status of the same while you are still on the call.</li>\n<li>Do it yourself – this is perhaps the most popular way to transact in the markets. The broker gives you access to the market via a ‘Trading Terminal’. After you log in to the trading terminal, you can view live price quotes from the market and place orders yourself. For example, Zerodha’s trading platform is called ‘Kite’.</li>\n<li>Advanced users can access the market programmatically via APIs. Some of the brokers provide APIs for a fee.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The essential services provided by the broker include…</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Access to the markets and allow you to transact</li>\n<li>Margins for trading, we will discuss this point at a later point</li>\n<li>Support in terms of call and trade, help you resolve queries, educate you on markets</li>\n<li>Issue contract notes for the transactions – A contract note is a written confirmation detailing the transactions you have carried out during the day.</li>\n<li>Facilitate the fund transfer between your trading and bank account</li>\n<li>Provide you with a back-office. The back office is a portal to access many reports about your account. Zerodha’s back office is called Console.</li>\n<li>The broker charges a fee for the services provided, also called the ‘brokerage charge’ or just brokerage. The brokerage rates vary, and it’s up to you to find a broker you think strikes a balance between the brokerage charged and the services provided.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><img alt=\"broker3\" class=\"sub-heading-img alignnone wp-image-191 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"48\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/broker3.png\" width=\"48\"/> 3.3 – Depository and Depository Participants</h2>\n<p>When you buy a property, the only way to identify and claim that you own the property is by producing the property papers. Hence, it becomes essential to keep the property papers safe and secure.</p>\n<p>Likewise, when you buy a share (a share represents part ownership in a company), the only way to claim ownership is by producing your share certificate. A share certificate is nothing but a document entitling you as the owner of the shares in a company. Before 1996 the share certificate was in paper format; however, post-1996, the share certificates were converted to digital form. Converting a paper format share certificate into a digital format share certificate is called “Dematerialization,” often abbreviated as DEMAT.</p>\n<p>Did you know the Harshad Mehta scam of 1992, played a significant role in digitizing the share certificate? I’d suggest you watch the SonyLiv series on the Harshad Mehta saga, it gives you a good perspective of the market’s ecosystem before it went digital.</p>\n<p>The share certificate in DEMAT format has to be stored digitally. The storage place for the digital share certificate is the ‘DEMAT Account. A Depository is a financial intermediary that offers the Demat account service.  Think of the demat account as a digital vault for your shares. As you may have guessed, your broker’s trading account and the DEMAT account from the Depository are interlinked.</p>\n<p>For example, if your idea is to buy Infosys shares, then all you need to do is open your trading account, look for Infosys’ prices, and buy it. Once the transaction is complete, the role of your trading account is done. After you buy, the shares of Infosys will automatically get credited to your demat account.</p>\n<p>Likewise, when you wish to sell Infosys shares, you must log in to your trading account and sell the stock. The act of selling is carried out in your trading account. But in the backend, because your trading account and demat account are linked, the broker debits your demat account of the shares you have sold.</p>\n<p>At present, only two depositaries offer DEMAT account services. The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Limited. There is virtually no difference between the two, and both operate under strict SEBI regulations.</p>\n<p>You cannot walk into National Stock Exchange’s (NSE) office to open a trading account, likewise, you cannot walk into a Depository (NSDL or CDSL) to open a demat account. To open a demat account, you must speak to a Depository Participant (DP). A DP helps you set up your DEMAT account with a Depository. A DP acts as an intermediary between you and the Depository. Even the DP is governed by the regulations laid out by the SEBI.</p>\n<p>Zerodha is a depositary participant of Central Depository Services (India) Limited (CDSL).</p>\n<h2><img alt=\"broker3\" class=\"sub-heading-img alignnone wp-image-191 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"48\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/broker3.png\" width=\"48\"/> 3.4 – Banks</h2>\n<p>Banks play a straightforward role in the market ecosystem. They help facilitate the fund transfer from your bank account to your trading account. Both the trading account and bank account are linked. Broker’s link these accounts after verifying your bank account.</p>\n<p>You can link multiple bank accounts to your trading through which you can transfer funds and trade. Irrespective of how many bank accounts you choose to link with your trading account, funds can be withdrawn to only one bank account. The account you choose to withdraw funds (from your trading account) is called the ‘Primary account.’ At Zerodha, you can add one primary bank account and up to 2 secondary bank accounts. You can add funds to all the bank accounts, but withdrawals are only processed to the primary bank account.</p>\n<p>Also, dividend payments and money from buybacks will be sent to the primary bank account. The primary bank account is connected to your trading account, the Depository, the Registrar, and the transfer agents (RTA).</p>\n<p>At this stage, you must have realized that the three financial intermediaries operate via three different accounts – a trading account offered by your broker, demat account offered by the depositary participant, and a Bank account offered by a bank. All three accounts operate electronically and are interlinked, giving you a seamless experience.</p>\n<h2><img alt=\"broker3\" class=\"sub-heading-img alignnone wp-image-191 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"48\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/broker3.png\" width=\"48\"/> 3.5 – NSE clearing Limited and ICCL</h2>\n<p>NSE Clearing Limited and Indian Clearing Corporation (ICCL) are wholly owned subsidiaries of the National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange, respectively.</p>\n<p>The job of the clearing corporation is to ensure guaranteed settlement of your trades/transactions. For example, if you buy one Biocon share at Rs.446 per share, someone must sell that one share to you at Rs.446. For this transaction, you will be debited Rs.446 from your trading account, and the seller must be credited that Rs.446 toward the sale of Biocon. In a typical transaction like this, the clearing corporation’s role is to ensure the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Identify the buyer and seller and match the debit and credit process</li>\n<li>Ensure no defaults – The clearing corporation also ensures no defaults by either party. For instance, after selling the shares, the seller should not be able to back out, thereby defaulting in his transaction.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For all practical purposes, it’s ok not to know much about NSE Clearing Limited or ICCL simply because you, as a trader or investor, would not be interacting with these agencies directly. You need to know these institutions are also heavily regulated and work towards a smooth settlement and efficient clearing activity.</p>\n<p>Clearing corporations are also involved in the margining process, which is critical while trading complex instruments like futures and options. Perhaps, we will discuss this aspect in a related discussion.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>The key takeaway from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The market ecosystem is built by a cluster of financial intermediaries, each offering services unique to the functioning of markets.</li>\n<li>A stockbroker is your market access, so choose a broker that matches your requirements.</li>\n<li>A stockbroker provides you with a trading account that is used for all market-related transactions (buying and selling of financial instruments like shares)</li>\n<li>A Depository is a corporate entity that holds the shares electronically in your name in your account. Your account with the depository is called the ‘DEMAT’ account.</li>\n<li>There are only two depositories in India – NSDL and CDSL.</li>\n<li>To open a DEMAT account with one of the depositaries, you must liaise with a Depository Participant (DP). A DP functions as an agent to the Depository</li>\n<li>A clearing corporation works towards clearing and settling trades executed by you.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

A good understanding of this topic lays a sound foundation for all future topics.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch4-title.jpg\"><img alt=\"Ch4-title\" class=\"size-full wp-image-185 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"268\" sizes=\"(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch4-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch4-title.jpg 515w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Ch4-title-300x156.jpg 300w\" width=\"515\"/></a>In this and the next chapter, we will learn about why companies go public and, in the process, also learn a few financial concepts.</p>\n<h2>4.2 – Origin of a Business</h2>\n<p>Before we seek an answer as to why companies go public, let us figure out a basic concept – the origins of a typical business. We will build a familiar story around this concept to understand IPOs better. Let us split this story into several scenes to understand how the business and the funding environment evolve and the circumstances that lead a company to list in the public market.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Scene 1 – The Angels</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"A\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-196\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"94\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/A.png\" width=\"170\"/></p>\n<p>Let us start our story. Imagine a passionate entrepreneur with a business idea – to manufacture highly fashionable, organic cotton t-shirts. The designs are unique, priced attractive, and the best quality cotton is used to manufacture these t-shirts. The entrepreneur is confident that the business will click and is enthusiastic about starting the business.</p>\n<p>As you’d imagine, the entrepreneur will face a typical problem – how to fund the idea? Assuming the entrepreneur has no business background, he/she will not attract any serious investors initially. Chances are, the entrepreneur will approach the family and immediate friends to pitch the idea and raise some money.</p>\n<p>Let us assume that the entrepreneur pools some of his money and convinces two good friends to invest in his business. These two friends invest in the business based on their trust in their friends. The two friends in this context are referred to as the <strong>Angel investors.</strong> Please note that angel money is not a loan but an investment in the business.</p>\n<p>So let us imagine that the promoter (entrepreneur) and the angels raise INR 5 Crore in capital. This initial money the business gets to kick start operations is called<strong> ‘The Seed Fund.’</strong> Sometimes, it is also called a ‘Friend &amp; Family round.’ It is important to note that the seed fund will not sit in the entrepreneur’s bank account but the company’s bank account.</p>\n<p>Angel funding need not always come from friends; there are professional angel investors who invest money in companies that they think are good.</p>\n<p>In return for the initial seed investment, the original three (promoter plus two angels) will be issued share certificates of the company, which entitles them to certain ownership. The only asset that the company has at this stage is cash. Hence the value of the company is only to the extent of the cash they own. In this case, the valuation is 5Crs.  Of course, one can argue that the company’s value is cash plus the company’s unique business idea, and therefore the valuation is beyond 5Crs, but we will not get into that.</p>\n<p>Issuing shares is quite simple; the company assumes that each share is worth Rs.10, and because there is Rs.5 crore as share capital, there have to be 50 lakh shares, with each share worth Rs.10. In this context, Rs.10 is called the ‘Face value’ (FV) of the share. The face value could be any number between Rs.1 to sometimes even above Rs.10 per share as restricted by SEBI DIB guidelines to protect investors. If the FV is Rs.5, the number of shares would be one crore, and so on.</p>\n<p>Backed by the seed fund, the promoter kick-starts business operations. The entrepreneur moves cautiously, hires the right people, establishes the right process, and starts manufacturing high-quality t-shirts. At this stage, the entrepreneur has one small manufacturing unit and one store to retail the product.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Scene 2 – The Venture Capitalist</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"V\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-198\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"89\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/V1.png\" width=\"200\"/></p>\n<p>The entrepreneur’s hard work pays off, and the business generates a steady revenue stream. The company starts to break even at the end of the first two years of operations. The promoter is no longer a rookie business owner. Instead, he is more knowledgeable about the business and, of course, more confident. Backed by confidence, the promoter wants to expand the business by adding one more manufacturing unit and a few additional retail stores in the city. The entrepreneur chalks out the plan and figures out that the fresh investment needed for business expansion is INR 7 Crs.</p>\n<p>The entrepreneur is now in a better situation when compared to two years ago. The big difference is the fact that the business is generating revenues. The healthy inflow of revenue validates the business and its offerings. The entrepreneur can now access reasonably savvy investors for investing in the business. The investor who typically invests in such an early stage of business is called a <strong>Venture Capitalist (VC),</strong> and the money that the business gets at this stage is called <strong>Series A</strong> funding.</p>\n<p>Assume the entrepreneur raises the 7 Crs required to expand the business. Typically when new investment flows into the business, the following happens –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is a dilution of shares by the promoter.</li>\n<li>The valuation of the business increases</li>\n<li>All the previous investors (in this case, the two angles) tend to make notional profits on their initial investment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With the VC’s money coming into the business, the notional value (valuation) increases, and therefore, notional wealth is created for early investors.</p>\n<p>As we advance with our story, the promoter now has the capital required for the business. As planned, the company gets an additional manufacturing unit and a few more retail outlets in the city. Things are going great; the product’s popularity is growing, translating into higher revenues. The management team gets more professional, thereby increasing operational efficiency, which translates to better profits.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Scene 3 – The Banker</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"B\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-199\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"91\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/B.png\" width=\"165\"/></p>\n<p>Three more years pass by, and the company is phenomenally successful. The company decides to have a retail presence in at least three more cities. To back the retail presence across three cities, the company plans to increase its production capacity and hire more resources. Whenever a company plans such expenditure to improve the overall business, the expenditure is called ‘Capital Expenditure’ or simply <strong>‘CAPEX’.</strong></p>\n<p>The management estimates 40Crs towards their CAPEX requirements. How does the company get this money, or in other words, how can the company fund its CAPEX requirements?</p>\n<p>There are a few options for the company to raise the required funds for their CAPEX:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The company has made some profits over the last few years; a part of the CAPEX requirement can be funded through the profits. This is also called funding through <strong>internal accruals.</strong></li>\n<li>The company can approach another VC and raise another round of VC funding by allotting shares; if they do, it’s called <strong>series B funding.</strong></li>\n<li>The company can approach a bank for a loan. The bank would be happy to tender this loan as the company has been doing fairly well. The loan is also called <strong>‘Debt.’</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Assume the company exercises all three options to raise funds for Capex. It plows back 15Crs from internal accruals, plans a series B – divests some equity for a consideration of 10Crs from another VC, and raises 15Crs debt from the bank.</p>\n<p>Note that the company’s valuation again increases with 10Crs coming in from series B. With the increase in valuations, the previous investors tend to make bigger notional profits.  Also, I would encourage you to think about the wealth created over the years. This is exactly what happens to entrepreneurs with great business ideas and a highly competent management team.</p>\n<p>Real-world examples of such wealth creation stories are companies like Infosys, Page Industries, Eicher Motors, Titan Industries, Bajaj Finserve, HDFC Bank, and internationally, one could think of Google, Apple, Amazon, etc. The list is quite exhaustive.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Scene 4 – The Private Equity</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"PE\" class=\"size-full wp-image-201 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"79\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PE.png\" width=\"175\"/></p>\n<p>A few years pass by, and the company’s success continues to grow, and with the growing success of this 8-year-old company, ambitions swell. The company decides to raise the bar and branch out across the country. They also diversify the company by manufacturing and retailing fashion accessories, designer cosmetics, and perfumes.</p>\n<p>The CAPEX requirement to fuel the new ambition is now pegged at 60 Crs. The company does not want to raise money through debt because of the interest rate burden, also called the <strong>finance</strong> <strong>charges</strong>, bites into the company’s profits. For example, suppose the company generates Rs.100 as profit and pays Rs.20 towards finance charges; the profitability is reduced to Rs.80. We will discuss more on this in the Fundamental Analysis module.</p>\n<p>The company decides on Series C funding. They cannot approach a typical VC because VC funding is usually small and runs into a few crores. This is when a <strong>Private Equity (PE)</strong> investor comes into the picture. Think about the PE as a big brother of a VC. Here are a few differences between a PE and VC –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>VCs tend to cut smaller cheques, while PE typically invests large amounts.</li>\n<li>VC invests in early-stage businesses and takes a much higher risk than PE. PEs invest at a mature stage and take on lesser risk compared to a VC</li>\n<li>PEs, upon investment, also take up a board seat in the company and oversee the company’s functioning.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>PE investors are quite savvy. They are highly qualified and have an excellent professional backgrounds. They invest large amounts of money to provide the capital for constructive use and place their people on the board of the investee company to ensure the company steers in the required direction.</p>\n<p>Usually, when a PE invests, they invest in funding large CAPEX requirements. Besides, they do not invest in the early stage of a business; instead, they prefer to invest in companies that already have a revenue stream and have been in operation for a few years. Deploying the PE capital and utilizing the capital for the CAPEX requirements takes a few years.</p>\n<p>Let us assume that the company raises funds via a Private Equity company and expands its business.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Scene 5 – The IPO</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"IPO\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-202\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"58\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IPO.png\" width=\"291\"/></p>\n<p>Fast forward 5 years after the PE investment, the company has progressed well. They have successfully diversified their product portfolio and have a presence across all the country’s major cities. Revenues are good, profitability is stable, and the investors are happy. The promoter, however, does not want to settle in for just this.</p>\n<p>The promoter now aspires to go international! The company now wants the brand available across all the major international cities, with at least two outlets in each major city worldwide.</p>\n<p>The company needs to invest in market research to understand the demographics of other countries, invest in people, and increase manufacturing capacities. Besides, they also need to invest in real estate space across the world. The CAPEX requirement is huge; the management estimates this at 200 Crs. The company has few options to fund the CAPEX requirement –</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Fund Capex from internal accruals</li>\n<li>Raise Series D from another PE fund</li>\n<li>Raise debt from bankers</li>\n<li>Float a bond (this is another form of raising debt)</li>\n<li>File for an Initial Public Offer (IPO)</li>\n<li>A combination of all the above</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For convenience, let us assume the company decides to fund the CAPEX partly through internal accruals and the rest via an IPO. When a company files for an IPO, they have to offer its shares to the general public. The general public will subscribe to the shares (i.e., if they want to) by paying a certain price. Now, because the company offers the shares for the first time to the public, it is called the <strong>“Initial Public Offer’</strong>.</p>\n<p>We are now at a crucial juncture where a few questions need to be answered.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Why did the company decide to file for an IPO? In general, why do companies go public?</li>\n<li>Why did they not file for the IPO when they were in Series A, B, and C situations?</li>\n<li>What would happen to the existing shareholders after the IPO?</li>\n<li>What does the general public look for before they subscribe to the IPO?</li>\n<li>How does the IPO process evolve?</li>\n<li>Which of the financial intermediaries are involved in the IPO markets?</li>\n<li>What happens after the company goes public?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the following chapter, we will address each of the above questions plus more, and we will also give you more insights into the IPO Market. Hopefully, from this chapter, you should have developed a sense of the sequence of events that would typically drive a company to raise funds via an IPO.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Before understanding why companies go public, it is important to understand the origin of business.</li>\n<li>The people who invest in your business in the pre-revenue stage are called Angel Investors.</li>\n<li>Angel investors take the maximum risk. They take in as much risk as the promoter.</li>\n<li>The money that angels give to start the business is called the seed fund.</li>\n<li>Angel’s invests a relatively small amount of capital</li>\n<li>The valuation of a company signifies how much the company is valued by considering the company’s assets, liabilities, and future growth prospects.</li>\n<li>Face value is simply a denominator to indicate how much one share is originally worth. Face value is also called the notional value of a share.</li>\n<li>The money the company spends on business expansion is called capital expenditure or CAPEX</li>\n<li>Series A, B, and C are funding the company seeks as it evolves. Usually, the newer the series,  the higher the company’s valuation.</li>\n<li>Beyond a certain size, VCs dont invest, and hence the company seeking investments will have to approach Private Equity firms.</li>\n<li>PE firms invest large sums of money, usually at a slightly more mature stage of the business.</li>\n<li>In terms of risk, PEs have a lower risk appetite as compared to VCs or angels.</li>\n<li>Typical PE investors post their people on the investee company’s board to ensure business moves in the right direction.</li>\n<li>The company’s valuation increases as and when the business, revenues, and profitability increase.</li>\n<li>An IPO is a process using which a company can raise funds from the general public. The funds raised can be for any valid reason – for CAPEX, restructuring debt, rewarding shareholders, etc</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

The idea behind creating the fictional story in the previous chapter was to give you a sense of how a business matures over time. Of course, many nuances were intentionally overlooked to drive the point across, and I hope that helped. The emphasis was on the different stages of business and funding options available at various stages of business.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ch5-title.jpg\"><img alt=\"Ch5-title\" class=\"size-full wp-image-256 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ch5-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ch5-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ch5-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>Circumstances leading to an IPO are extremely important to understand because the IPO market, also called the <strong>Primary market</strong>, sometimes attracts many new first-time stock market investors. In this chapter, we will understand the IPO process and the many different aspects of a company’s IPO.</p>\n<h2>5.2 – Why do companies go public?</h2>\n<p>We closed the previous chapter with a few unanswered questions: Why did the company decide to file for an IPO, and in general, why do companies go public?</p>\n<p>When a company decides to file for an IPO, one of the main reasons is to raise funds to fuel its CAPEX requirement. Apart from this, there are several other reasons for an IPO, sometimes, a company raises funds via IPO to reduce a high-cost debt, or sometimes a company can IPO to give an exit for an early-stage investor. Here is something interesting you can do. Think about a company that went IPO recently, and google for the IPO reason, and you’ll know why the company went public.</p>\n<p>The promoter has three advantages in taking his company public –</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Raise  funds to meet CAPEX requirement</li>\n<li>Avoid the need to raise debt which means there are no finance charges to pay, which further translates to better profitability.</li>\n<li>The promoter can spread the risk amongst a large group of investors instead of one large investor. 100s and thousands of retail investors are better than one large private equity investor.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are other advantages as well in filing for an IPO –</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Provide an exit for early investors</strong> – Once the company goes public, the shares of the company start trading publicly. Any existing company shareholders– promoters, angel investors, venture capitalists, or PE funds; can use this opportunity to sell their shares in the open market. By selling their shares, they get an exit on their initial investment in the company. Of course, there is a lock-in period before which early investors cant exit, but that is beside the point.</li>\n<li><strong>Reward employees</strong> –Employees, working for the company would have shares allotted to them as an incentive. This arrangement between the employee and the company is called the “Employee Stock Option” or ESOPS. The shares are allotted at a discount to the employees. Once the company goes public, the employees can see capital appreciation in the shares. A few examples where the employee benefited from ESOP would be Google, Infosys, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, etc</li>\n<li><strong>Improve visibility</strong> – Going public increases visibility as the company is publicly held and traded. There is a greater chance of people’s interest in the company, consequently impacting its growth.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>5.3 – Merchant Bankers</h2>\n<p>Having decided to go public, the company must do a series of things to ensure a successful initial public offering. The first and foremost step would be to appoint a <strong>merchant banker. </strong>Merchant bankers are called <strong>Book Running Lead Managers (BRLM)/Lead Managers (LM).</strong> The job of a merchant banker is to assist the company with various aspects of the IPO process, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Conduct due diligence on the company filing for an IPO, ensure their legal compliance and issue a due diligence certificate.</li>\n<li>Work closely with the company and prepare their listing documents, including <strong>Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP). </strong>We will discuss this in a bit more detail at a later stage.</li>\n<li><strong>Underwriting shares</strong> – In underwriting shares, merchant bankers agree to take up the unsubscribed portion of an IPO. The underwriting is taken up for fresh shares issued during the IPO. The merchant banker takes up the remaining shares if the subscription is above a defined threshold but is not subscribed fully. If the subscription is below the threshold, the IPO is deemed to have failed. All investor money is unblocked in the investors’ accounts. In March 2020, Anthony Waste Limited IPO’s subscription was below the threshold.</li>\n<li>Help the company arrive at the price band for the IPO. A <strong>price band</strong> is the lower and upper limit of the share price within which the company will sell its shares to IPO applicants. For example, the current IPO of Keystone Realtors Limited has a price band of Rs.514 to Rs.541.</li>\n<li>Help the company with the roadshows. The roadshow is like a promotional/marketing activity for the company’s IPO</li>\n<li>Appointment of other intermediaries, namely, registrars, bankers, advertising agencies, etc. The Lead manager also makes various marketing strategies for the issue.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once the company partners with the merchant banker, they will work towards taking the company public.</p>\n<h2>5.4 – IPO sequence of events</h2>\n<p>Every step in the IPO sequence must happen under the SEBI guidelines. In general, the following is the sequence of steps involved.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Appoint a merchant banker</strong>. In case of a large public issue, the company can appoint more than one merchant banker</li>\n<li><strong>Apply to SEBI with a registration statement</strong> – The registration statement contains details on what the company does, why the company plans to go public, and the financial health of the company</li>\n<li><strong>Getting a nod from SEBI</strong> – Once SEBI receives the registration statement, SEBI takes a call on whether to issue a go-ahead or a ‘no go’ to the IPO</li>\n<li><strong>DRHP </strong>– If the company gets the initial SEBI nod, then the company needs to prepare the DRHP. A DRHP is a document that gets circulated to the public. Along with a lot of information, DRHP should contain the following details:\n<ul>\n<li>The estimated size of the IPO</li>\n<li>The estimated number of shares being offered to the public</li>\n<li>Why the company wants to go public, and how does the company plan to utilize the funds along with the timeline projection of fund utilization</li>\n<li>Business description including the revenue model, expenditure details</li>\n<li>Complete financial statements</li>\n<li>Management Discussion and Analysis – how the company perceives future business operations to emerge</li>\n<li>Risks involved in the business</li>\n<li>Management details and their background</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"></li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Market the IPO</strong> – This would involve TV and print advertisements to build awareness about the company and its IPO offering. This process is also called the IPO roadshow.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix the price band</strong> – Decide the price band between which the company would like to go public. Of course, this can’t be way off the general perception. If it is, then the public will not subscribe to the IPO</li>\n<li><strong>Book Building</strong> – Once the roadshow is done and the price band fixed, the company has to officially open the window during which the public can subscribe for shares. For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.120, the public can choose a price they think is fair enough for the IPO issue. The process of collecting all these price points and the respective quantities is called Book Building. Book building is perceived as an effective price discovery method.</li>\n<li><strong>Closure</strong> – After the book building window is closed (generally open for a few days), the price point at which the issue gets listed is decided. This price point is usually the price at which maximum bids have been received.</li>\n<li><strong>Listing Day</strong> – This is the day when the company gets listed on the stock exchange. The listing price is the price decided based on market demand and supply on that day and the stock is listed at a premium, par, or discount of the cut-off price.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>5.5 – What happens after the IPO?</h2>\n<p>During the bidding process, investors can bid for shares at a particular price within the specified price band.  This whole system is referred to as the Primary Market around the date of the issue where one bids for shares. The moment the stock gets listed and debuts on the stock exchange, the stock starts to trade publicly. This is called the <strong>secondary market</strong>.</p>\n<p>Once the stock transitions from primary to secondary markets, the stock gets traded daily on the stock exchange. People transact (buy or sell) these listed shares regularly.</p>\n<p>Why do people trade? Why does the stock price fluctuate? We will answer all these questions and more in the subsequent chapters.</p>\n<h2>5.6 – Few key IPO jargon</h2>\n<p>Before we wrap up the chapter on IPOs, let us review a few important IPO jargons.</p>\n<p><em><img alt=\"glossary\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-283\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"19\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\" width=\"26\"/></em>Under subscription – Let’s say the company wants to offer 100,000 shares to the public. During the book-building process, it was discovered that only 90,000 bids were received, then the issue is said to be under-subscribed. This is not a great situation, as it indicates negative public sentiment.</p>\n<p><em><em><img alt=\"glossary\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-283\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"19\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\" width=\"26\"/> </em></em>Oversubscription – If there are 200,000 bids for 100,000 shares on offer, then the issue is said to be oversubscribed two times (2x)</p>\n<p><em><em><img alt=\"glossary\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-283\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"19\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\" width=\"26\"/> </em></em>Green Shoe Option<em> – </em>Part of the issue document that allows the issuer to authorize additional shares (typically 15 percent) to be distributed in the event of oversubscription. This is also called the overallotment option.</p>\n<p><em><em><img alt=\"glossary\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-283\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"19\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\" width=\"26\"/> </em></em>Fixed Price IPO<em> –</em>Sometimes, the companies fix the price of the IPO and do not opt for a price band. Such issues are called fixed-price IPO</p>\n<p><em><em><img alt=\"glossary\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-283\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"19\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\" width=\"26\"/> </em></em>Price Band and Cut off price<em> –</em>A price band is a price range between which the stock gets listed. For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.130, then the issue can list within the range. Let’s say it gets listed at 125; 125 is the cut-off price.</p>\n<h2>5.6 – Recent IPOs in India</h2>\n<p>Here is a look at a few recent IPOs in India. With all the background information you now have, reading this table should be easy.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Name of Issue</th>\n<th>IPO Size (INR Crs)</th>\n<th>BRLM</th>\n<th>Listing date</th>\n<th></th>\n<th>Price Band (INR)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Adani Wilmar Limited</td>\n<td>3600</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Kotak, JP Morgan, ICIC</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">8th Feb 2022</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>218 – 230</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Delhivery Limited</td>\n<td>5235</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Kotak, BoFA, Citi</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">24th May 2022</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>462 – 487</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Ethos India</td>\n<td>472</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Emkay, InCred Capital</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">30th May 2022</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>468-472</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Aether Industries Limited</td>\n<td>808</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">HDFC, Kotak</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3rd June 2022</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>610 – 642</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Tracxn Technologies Limited</td>\n<td>310</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">IIFL Securities</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">20th Oct 2022</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>75 – 80</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I hope the last two chapters gave you a sense of why a company files for an IPO and what happens during an IPO. In the next chapter, we focus on understanding the secondary markets and all the nuances around the secondary market. <em><br/>\n</em></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Companies go public to raise funds, provide an exit for early investors, reward employees and gain visibility.</li>\n<li>Merchant banker acts as a key partner with the company during the IPO process.</li>\n<li>SEBI regulates the  IPO market and has the  final word on whether a company can go public or not</li>\n<li>As an investor in the IPO, you should read through the DRHP to know everything about the company.</li>\n<li>Most of the IPOs in India follow a book-building process.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>6.1 – Public Limited company</h2>\n<p>Having understood the IPO process and the circumstances that lead a company to offer its shares to the public and raise funds,  we are now set to explore the stock markets a step further.</p>\n<p>Once a company becomes publicly traded, the company is obligated to disclose all information related to the company to the public. The shares of a public limited company are traded on the stock exchanges daily. There are a few reasons why market participants trade stocks. We will explore some of these reasons in this chapter.</p>\n<h2>6.2 – What is the stock market?</h2>\n<p>As we discussed earlier, the stock market is an electronic marketplace. Buyers and sellers electronically express their points of view in terms of trade.</p>\n<p>For example, consider the current situation of Infosys. When writing this, Infosys faces a management succession issue, and most of the company’s senior-level executives are resigning. The leadership vacuum is weighing down the company’s reputation heavily. As a result, the stock price dropped to Rs.3,000 from Rs.3,500.</p>\n<p>Assume there are two traders – A and B.</p>\n<p>A’s view on Infosys – The stock price will likely go down further because the company will find it challenging to find a new CEO. If A trades from his point of view, he should be a seller of the Infosys stock.</p>\n<p>However, B views the same situation differently and has a different point of view. According to her, the stock price of Infosys has overreacted to the succession issue, and soon the company will find a great leader. The stock price will eventually move up.</p>\n<p>If B trades from her point of view, she should be a buyer of the Infosys stock.</p>\n<p>So at, Rs.3000, A will be a seller, and B will be a buyer in Infosys.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ch-6-title.jpg\"><img alt=\"Ch-6-title\" class=\"size-full wp-image-260 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ch-6-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ch-6-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ch-6-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now both A and B will place orders to sell and buy the stocks respectively through their respective stock brokers. The stock broker routes it to the stock exchange. The stock exchange has to ensure that these two orders are matched and that the trade is executed. This is the primary job of the stock market – to facilitate the transactions between different market participants.</p>\n<p>A stock market is where market participants can access any publicly listed company and trade from their point of view as long as other participants have an opposing point of view. After all, different opinions are what make a market.</p>\n<h2>6.3 – What moves the stock?</h2>\n<p>Let us continue with the Infosys example to understand how stocks move. Imagine you are a market participant tracking Infosys.</p>\n<p>It is 10:00 AM Infosys is trading at Rs.3000 per share. The management makes a press statement that they have found a new CEO expected to steer the company to greater heights. They are confident that the newly appointed CEO will do good things for the company.</p>\n<p>Two questions –</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>How will the stock price of Infosys react to this news?</li>\n<li>If you were to place a trade on Infosys, what would it be? Would it be a buy or a sell?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The answer to the first question is quite simple; the news is positive, so the stock price will increase. Infosys had a leadership issue, and the company has fixed it. When positive announcements are made, market participants tend to buy the stock at any given price, which cascades into a stock price rally.</p>\n<p>Let me illustrate this further :</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Time</th>\n<th>Last Traded Price</th>\n<th>What price the seller wants</th>\n<th>What does the buyer do?</th>\n<th>New Last Trade Price</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>10:00</td>\n<td>3000</td>\n<td>3002</td>\n<td>Buys</td>\n<td>3002</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>10:01</td>\n<td>3002</td>\n<td>3006</td>\n<td>Buys</td>\n<td>3006</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>10:03</td>\n<td>3006</td>\n<td>3011</td>\n<td>Buys</td>\n<td>3011</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>10:05</td>\n<td>3011</td>\n<td>3016</td>\n<td>Buys</td>\n<td>3016</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Notice that the buyer is willing to pay whatever prices the seller wants; this is when the market is said to be bullish. In a bullish market, the prices tend to move up.</p>\n<p>So as you can see, the stock price jumped 16 Rupees in a matter of 5 minutes. Though this is a fictional situation, it is a realistic and typical behavior of stocks. The stock price increases when the news is good or expected to be good.</p>\n<p>In this particular case, the stock moves up because of two reasons. One, the leadership issue has been fixed, and two, there is also an expectation that the new CEO will steer the company to greater heights.</p>\n<p>The answer to the second question is now quite simple; you buy Infosys stocks because there is good news surrounding the stock.</p>\n<p>Now, moving forward on the same day, at 12:30 PM, ‘The National Association of Software &amp; Services company’ (NASSCOM) makes a statement stating that the customer’s IT budget seems to have come down by 15%, which could have an impact on the industry in the future. For those unaware, NASSCOM is a trade association of Indian IT companies.</p>\n<p>By 12:30 PM, let us assume Infosys is trading at 3030. Few questions for you…</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>How does this new information impact Infosys?</li>\n<li>What would it be if you were to initiate a new trade with this information?</li>\n<li>What would happen to the other IT stocks in the market?</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The answers to the above questions are quite simple. Before we answer these questions, let us analyze NASSCOM’s statement in more detail.</p>\n<p>NASSCOM says that the IT budget is likely to shrink by 15%. This means IT companies’ revenues and profits will likely go down soon. This is not great news for the IT industry.</p>\n<p>Let us now try and answer the above questions…</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Infosys is a leading IT major in the country and will react to this news. The reaction could be mixed because there was good news specific to Infosys earlier during the day. However, a 15% decline in revenue is a serious matter, and hence Infosys stocks are likely to trade lower.</li>\n<li>At 3030, if one were to initiate a new trade based on the new information, it would be a sell on Infosys.</li>\n<li>The information released by NASSCOM applies to the entire IT stocks and not just Infosys. Hence all IT companies are likely to witness selling pressure.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So as you notice, market participants react to news and events, and their reaction translates to price movements! This is what makes the stocks move.</p>\n<p>At this stage, you may wonder what would happen to a company’s share price if there is no news. Will the stock price stay flat and not move at all? The answer is yes and no, depending on the company in focus.</p>\n<p>For example, let us assume there is no news concerning two different companies…</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Reliance Industries Limited</li>\n<li>Shree Lakshmi Sugar Mills</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As we all know, Reliance is one the largest companies in the country, and regardless of whether there is news or not, market participants would like to buy or sell the company’s shares, and therefore the price moves constantly.</p>\n<p>The second company is relatively unknown and, therefore, may not attract market participants’ attention as there is no news or event surrounding this company. Under such circumstances, the stock price may not move, or even if it does, it may be very marginal.</p>\n<p>To summarize, the price moves because of expectations of news and events. The news or events can be directly related to the company, industry, or the economy as a whole. For instance, the appointment of Narendra Modi as the Indian Prime Minister was perceived as positive news, and therefore the whole stock market moved.</p>\n<p>In some cases, there would be no news, but still, the price could move due to the demand and supply situation.</p>\n<h2>6.4 – How does the stock get traded?</h2>\n<p>You have decided to buy 200 shares of Infosys at 3030 and hold on to it for one year. How does it work? What is the exact process of buying the stock? What happens after you buy it?</p>\n<p>Systems work seamlessly to ensure your transactions go smoothly.</p>\n<p>With your decision to buy Infosys, you need to log in to your trading account (provided by your stock broker) and place an order to buy Infosys. Once you place an order, the following details are validated –</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Details of your trading account through which you intend to buy Infosys shares.</li>\n<li>The price at which you intend to buy Infosys</li>\n<li>The number of shares you intend to buy</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before your broker transmits this order to the exchange, the broker has to ensure you have sufficient money to buy these shares. If yes, then this order hits the stock exchange. Once the order hits the market, the stock exchange (through their order matching algorithm) tries to find a seller who is willing to sell you 200 shares of Infosys at 3030.</p>\n<p>Now the seller could be one person willing to sell the entire 200 shares at 3030, or it could be ten people selling 20 shares each, or two people selling 1 and 199 shares, respectively. The permutation and combination do not matter. From your perspective, all you need is 200 shares of Infosys at 3030, and you have placed an order for the same. The stock exchange ensures the shares are available to you as long as sellers are in the market.</p>\n<p>Once the trade is executed, the shares will be electronically credited to your DEMAT account. Likewise, the shares will be electronically debited from the seller’s DEMAT account.</p>\n<h2>6.5 – What happens after you own stock?</h2>\n<p>After you buy the shares, the shares will reside in your DEMAT account. You are now a part owner of the company to the extent of your shareholding. To give you a perspective, if you own 200 shares of Infosys, you own 0.000035% of Infosys at the time of writing this chapter.</p>\n<p>By owning the shares, you are entitled to corporate benefits like dividends, stock splits, bonuses, rights issues, voting rights, etc. We will explore all these shareholder privileges at a later stage.</p>\n<h2>6.6 – A note on the holding period</h2>\n<p>The holding period is the period you intend to hold the stock. You may be surprised that the holding period could be as short as a few minutes to as long as ‘forever.’ When the legendary investor Warren Buffet was asked what his favorite holding period was, he replied ‘forever.’</p>\n<p>In the earlier example quoted in this chapter, we illustrated how Infosys stocks moved from 3000 to 3016 in 5 minutes. Well, this is not a bad return after all, for a 5 Minute holding period! If you are satisfied with it, you can close the trade and move on to find another opportunity. To remind you, this is very much possible in real markets. When things are hot, such moves are quite common.</p>\n<h2>6.7 – How to calculate returns?</h2>\n<p>Now, everything in markets boils down to one thing. Generating a reasonable rate of return! All past stock market sins are forgiven if your trade generates a good return. Returns are usually expressed in terms of annual yield. There are different kinds of returns that you need to be aware of. The following will give you a sense of what they are and how to calculate these returns.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Absolute Return</em></strong> – This is the return that your trade or investment generates in absolute terms. It helps you answer this question – I bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it at 3550. How much percentage return did I generate?</p>\n<p>The formula to calculate is – [Ending Period Value / Starting Period Value – 1]*100</p>\n<p>i.e. [3550/3030 -1] *100</p>\n<p>= 0.1716 * 100</p>\n<p>= 17.16%</p>\n<p>A 17.6% is not a bad return at all!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)</strong> –</em> An absolute return can be misleading if you want to compare two investments. CAGR helps you answer this question – I bought Infosys at 3030, held the stock for two years, and sold it at 3550. At what rate did my investment grow over the last two years?</p>\n<p>CAGR factors in the time component, which we had ignored when we computed the absolute return.</p>\n<p>The formula to calculate CAGR is…</p>\n<p><img alt=\"CAGR\" class=\"size-full wp-image-224 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"74\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CAGR.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CAGR.jpg 305w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CAGR-300x73.jpg 300w\" width=\"305\"/></p>\n<p>Applying this to answer the question…</p>\n<p>{[3550/3030]^(1/2) – 1} = 8.2%</p>\n<p>This means the investment grew at a rate of 8.2% for two years. As of today, the bank fixed deposit market offers 5.5% with capital protection hence, 8.2% return looks ok compared to a fixed deposit.</p>\n<p>So, always use CAGR to check returns over multiple years. Use absolute return when your time frame is for a year or lesser.</p>\n<p>What if you bought Infosys at 3030 and sold it at 3550 within six months? In that case, you have generated 17.16% in 6 months, which translates to 34.32% (17.16% * 2) for the year.</p>\n<p>So the point is if you have to compare returns, it’s best done when the return is expressed on an annualized basis.</p>\n<h2>6.8 – Where do you fit in?</h2>\n<p>Each market participant has a unique style of participating in the market. The style evolves as you progress as a participant and witness market cycles. The participation style is also defined by the risk you are willing to take in the market. Regardless of what you do, you can be categorized as a trader or investor.</p>\n<p>A trader is a person who spots an opportunity and initiates the trade with an expectation of profitably exiting the trade at the earliest given opportunity. A trader usually has a short-term view of markets.  Trader is alert and on their toes during market hours, constantly evaluating opportunities based on risk and reward. A trader is unbiased toward going long or going short. We will discuss what going long or short means at a later stage.</p>\n<p>There are different types of traders :</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><strong>Day Trader</strong> – A day trader initiates and closes the position during the day. He does not carry forward trading positions overnight. A day trader is risk-averse and does not like taking an overnight risk. For example – Buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 at 9:15 AM and sell it at 2220 at 3:20 PM, making a profit of Rs.800/- in this trade. A day trader usually trades 5 to 6 stocks per day, sometimes even more.</li>\n<li><strong>Scalper</strong> – A type of day trader. A scalper usually trades very large shares and holds the stock for less time to make a small but quick profit. For example – a scalper buys 10,000 shares of TCS as 2212 at 9:15 and sells it 2212.1 at 9.16, ending up making 1000/- profit in this trade. On any given day, the scalper trades multiple times during the day. As you may have noticed, a scalp trader is highly risk-averse.</li>\n<li><strong>Swing Trader</strong> – A swing trader holds on to the trade for a slightly longer; the duration can run anywhere between a few days to weeks. For example – Buy 100 shares of TCS at 2212 on 12<sup>th</sup> June and sell it at 2214 on 19<sup>th</sup> June.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some of the successful traders are – George Soros, Ed Seykota, Paul Tudor, Micheal Steinhardt, Van K Tharp, Stanley Druckenmiller, and the late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala etc</p>\n<p>An investor is a person who buys a stock expecting a significant appreciation in the stock. The investor is willing to wait for the investment to evolve. The typical holding period of investors usually runs into a few years. There are two popular types of investors.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><strong>Growth Investors</strong> – The objective here is to identify companies expected to grow significantly because of emerging industry and macro trends. A classic example in the Indian context would be buying Hindustan Unilever, Infosys, and Gillette India back in 1990s. These companies witnessed huge growth because of the change in the industry landscape, creating massive wealth for their shareholders.</li>\n<li><strong>Value Investors</strong> – The objective here is to identify good companies irrespective of whether they are in the growth or mature phase but beaten down significantly due to the short-term market sentiment, thereby making a great value buy. An example of this in recent times is stock tanking in the Covid crash of March 2020. Due to short-term negative sentiment, almost all the good stocks were beaten down significantly around March/April 2020, only to post a V-shaped recovery in the subsequent months.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A few successful investors are – Charlie Munger, Peter Lynch, Benjamin Graham, Thomas Rowe, Warren Buffett, John C Bogle, John Templeton, Mohnish Pabrai etc.</p>\n<p>So what kind of market participant would you like to be?</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>A stock market is where a trader or an investor can transact (buy, sell) in shares.</li>\n<li>A stock market is a place where the buyer and seller meet electronically</li>\n<li>Different opinions make a market</li>\n<li>The stock exchange electronically facilitates the transaction of buyers and sellers.</li>\n<li>News and events move the stock prices daily.</li>\n<li>Demand-supply mismatch also makes the stock prices move</li>\n<li>When you own a stock, you get corporate privileges like bonuses, dividends, rights, etc</li>\n<li>The holding period is defined as the period during which you hold your shares</li>\n<li>Use absolute returns when the holding period is one year or less.

The wiser thing for you to do would be to quickly check a few important roads and junctions across the city’s four directions and observe how the traffic is moving. If you observe chaotic conditions across these roads, you can conclude the traffic situation is chaotic; else, traffic can be considered normal.</p>\n<p>The few important roads and junctions you tracked to summarize the traffic situation served as a barometer for the entire city’s traffic situation!</p>\n<p>Drawing parallels, if I were to ask you how the stock market is moving today, how would you answer my question? There are approximately 5,000 listed companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange and about 2,000 on the National Stock Exchange. It would be clumsy to check every company, figure out if they are up or down for the day, and then give a detailed answer.</p>\n<p>Instead, you would check a few important companies across key industrial sectors. If a majority of these companies are moving up, you would say markets are up; if the majority are down, you would say markets are down; and if there is a mixed trend, you would say markets are sideways or flat for the day.</p>\n<p>So essentially, identify a few companies to represent the broader markets. Whenever someone asks you how the markets are doing, you check the general trend of these selected stocks and then answer. These companies that you have identified collectively make up the stock market index!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ch-7-title.jpg\"><img alt=\"Ch-7-title\" class=\"size-full wp-image-269 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ch-7-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ch-7-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ch-7-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<h2>7.2 – The Index</h2>\n<p>Luckily you need not track these selected companies individually to get a sense of how the markets are doing. The important companies are pre-packaged and continuously monitored to give you this information. This pre-packaged market sentiment indicator is called the ‘Stock market Index.’</p>\n<p>There are a few important indices in India. The <strong>S&amp;P BSE Sensex</strong> represents the Bombay stock exchange, and <strong>the Nifty 50</strong> represents the National Stock exchange. Apart from these two, there is the <strong>Nifty Bank Index</strong> (Bank Nifty), which is quite popular. Bank Nifty represents the banking sector as a whole.</p>\n<p>S&amp;P stands for Standard and Poor’s, a global credit rating agency. S&amp;P has the technical expertise in constructing the index they have licensed to the BSE. Hence the index also carries the S&amp;P tag. NSE itself maintains the indices via a related company called NSE Indices Limited.</p>\n<p>Nifty 50 consists of the most frequently traded stocks on the National Stock Exchange; we will soon discuss the methodology basis on which these indices are constructed. An ideal index gives us an updated, accurate representation of the market sentiment. The movements in the Index reflect the changing expectations of the market participants. When the index goes up, it is because the market participants think the future will be better. The index drops if the market participants perceive the future pessimistically.</p>\n<h2>7.3 – Practical uses of the Index</h2>\n<p>Some of the practical uses of Index are discussed below.</p>\n<p><strong><em><img alt=\"info\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-263\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/info.png\" width=\"131\"/>Information</em></strong><em> – </em>The index reflects the overall sentiment and trend in the market.  The index broadly represents the country’s state of the economy. A stock market index that is up indicates people are optimistic about the future. Likewise, people are pessimistic about the future when the stock market index is down.</p>\n<p>For example, the Nifty 50 value as of 21st November 2022 is 18150, but around six months ago, the Nifty 50 was at 15820. The index has moved 2300 points or about 14.75% higher in six months, indicating bullishness in the market. In other words, market participants have been optimistic about the Indian economic future.</p>\n<p>The time frame for calculating the index can be for anything. For example, the Index at 9:30 AM on 21st November was 18140, but an hour later, it moved to 18099. A drop of nearly 40 within an hour. Such movement indicates that the market participants are not enthusiastic from a short-term perspective.</p>\n<p><strong><em><img alt=\"benchmark\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-262\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/benchmark.png\" width=\"131\"/>Benchmarking</em></strong><em> – </em>A yardstick to measure the performance is required for all the trading or investing activity people do.  Assume over the last year, you invested Rs.100,000/- and generated Rs.20,000 return to make your total corpus Rs.120,000/-. How do you think you performed? Well, on the face of it, a 20% return looks great. However, what if Nifty moved to 30% during the same year?</p>\n<p>Well, suddenly, it may seem to you that you have underperformed in the market! Usually, the objective of market participants is to outperform the Index. Now, if not for the Index, you can’t figure out how you performed in the stock market. It would be best if you had the index to benchmark the performance.</p>\n<p><strong><em><img alt=\"trade\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-265\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/trade.png\" width=\"131\"/>Trading</em></strong> – Trading on the index is probably one of the most popular uses of the index. Majority of the traders in the market trade the index. They take a broader call on the economy or general state of affairs and translate that into a trade. The trader usually takes a short-term call on the index to trade.</p>\n<p>For example, imagine this situation. At 10:30 AM, the Finance Minister is expected to deliver the budget speech. An hour before the announcement Nifty index is at 18,150 points. You expect the budget to be favorable to the nation’s economy. What do you think will happen to the index? Naturally, the index will move up. So to trade your point of view, you may want to buy the index at 18,150. After all, the index is the representation of the broader economy.</p>\n<p>So as per your expectation, the budget is good, and the index moves to 18,450. You can now book your profits and exit the trade at a 300 points profit!  Trades such as these are possible through what is known as the ‘Derivative’ segment of the markets. We are probably a bit early to explore derivatives, but for now, do remember that index trading is possible through the derivative markets.</p>\n<p><strong><em><img alt=\"portfolio\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-264\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/portfolio.png\" width=\"131\"/>Portfolio Hedgin</em></strong><em><strong>g</strong> – </em>Investors usually build a portfolio of stocks. A typical portfolio contains 15 – 20 held for the long term. While the stocks are held from a long-term perspective, they could foresee a prolonged adverse movement in the market (ex-2008), potentially eroding the capital in the portfolio. Investors can use the index to hedge the portfolio in such a situation. We will explore this topic in a futures trading module.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>7.4 – Index construction methodology</h2>\n<p>Knowing how the index is constructed is important, especially if one wants to advance as an index trader. As we discussed, the Index is a composition of many stocks from different sectors representing the economy’s state. To include a stock in the index, it should qualify for certain criteria. Once qualified as an index stock, it should continue to qualify on the stated criteria. If it fails to maintain the criteria, the stock gets replaced by another stock that qualifies the prerequisites.</p>\n<p>Based on the selection procedure, the list of stocks is populated. Each stock in the index should be assigned a certain weightage. Weightage, in simpler terms, defines how much importance a certain stock in the index gets compared to the others.  For example, if ITC Limited has a 3.85% weightage in the Nifty 50 index, it is as good as saying that 3.85% of Nifty’s movement can be attributed to ITC. You can check the weights of all index stocks <a href=\"https://www.niftyindices.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The obvious question is – How do we assign weights to the stock that make up the Index?</p>\n<p>There are many ways to assign weights, but the Indian stock exchange follows a <strong>free-float market capitalization method.</strong> The weights are assigned based on the company’s free-float market capitalization. The larger the market capitalization, the higher the weight.</p>\n<p>Free float market capitalization is the product of the total number of shares outstanding in the market and the stock price.</p>\n<p>For example, company ABC has 100 shares outstanding in the market, and the stock price is at 50, then the free-float market cap of ABC is 100*50 = Rs.5,000.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing this chapter, the following are the top 10 index heavyweight-</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table style=\"height: 1310px;\" width=\"524\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Name of the company</th>\n<th>Industry</th>\n<th>The weightage (%)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>Reliance Industries Ltd</td>\n<td>Oil &amp; Gas</td>\n<td>11.03</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>HDFC Bank Ltd</td>\n<td>Bank</td>\n<td>8.26</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>ICICI Bank Ltd</td>\n<td>Bank</td>\n<td>7.94</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>Infosys Ltd</td>\n<td>IT</td>\n<td>7.06</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>HDFC Ltd</td>\n<td>Housing</td>\n<td>5.62</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td>TCS Ltd</td>\n<td>IT</td>\n<td>4.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td>ITC Ltd</td>\n<td>FMCG</td>\n<td>3.85</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td>Kotak Mahindra Bank</td>\n<td>Bank</td>\n<td>3.51</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td>L&amp;T Ltd</td>\n<td>Infra</td>\n<td>3.07</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Axis Bank Ltd</td>\n<td>Bank</td>\n<td>3.0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As you can see, Reliance Industries Ltd has the highest weightage. This means the Nifty index is most sensitive to price changes in Reliance.</p>\n<h2>7.5 – Sector-specific indices</h2>\n<p>While the Sensex and Nifty represent the broader markets, certain indices represent specific sectors. These are called sectoral indices. For example, the Bank Nifty on NSE represents the mood specific to the banking industry. The CNX IT on NSE represents the behavior of all the IT stocks in the stock markets. Both BSE and NSE have sector-specific indexes.  The construction and maintenance of these indices are similar to the other major indices.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li> An index acts as a barometer of the whole economy.</li>\n<li>An index going up indicates that the market participants are optimistic.</li>\n<li>An index going down indicates that the market participants are pessimistic.</li>\n<li>There are two main indices in India – The BSE Sensex and NSE’s Nifty 50</li>\n<li> An index can be used for various purposes – information, benchmarking, trading and hedging.</li>\n<li> Index trading is probably the most popular use of the index.</li>\n<li>India follows the free-float market capitalization method to construct the index.</li>\n<li> There are sector-specific indices that convey the sentiment of specific sectors.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

From a broader perspective, if the stock market index is going up during a particular period, it is referred to as a bull market.

If the market is trading flat with no movement, then the trend is said to be sideways.</p>\n<p><strong><em><strong><em><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\"><img alt=\"glossary\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-283\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"19\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\" width=\"26\"/></a> </em></strong></em></strong>Face value of a stock – The face value (FV) or par value indicates the nominal value of a share. The face value is important from a corporate action perspective. We will discuss corporate action in a separate chapter. Usually, when dividends, stock splits, or bonuses are announced, they are issued, keeping the face value in perspective. For example, the FV of Infosys is 5, and if they announce an annual dividend of Rs.63/-, the dividend paid is 1260%s (63 divided by 5).</p>\n<p><strong><em><strong><em><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\"><img alt=\"glossary\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-283\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"19\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\" width=\"26\"/></a> </em></strong></em></strong>52-week high/low – 52-week high is the highest price point at which a stock has traded during the last 52 weeks (which also marks a full calendar year); likewise, a 52-week low marks the lowest price point at which the stock has traded during the last 52 weeks. The 52-week high and low gives a sense of the range within which the stock trades during the year. Many traders believe that if a stock price reaches 52 weeks high, it indicates a bullish trend for the foreseeable future. Similarly, if a stock hits 52 week low, some traders believe it indicates a bearish trend for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p><strong><em><strong><em><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\"><img alt=\"glossary\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-283\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"19\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\" width=\"26\"/></a> </em></strong></em></strong>All-time high/low – This is similar to the 52 weeks high and low, with the only difference being that the all-time high price is the highest price the stock had ever traded from when it was listed. Similarly, the all-time low price is the lowest price the stock had ever traded from when it was listed.</p>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\"><img alt=\"glossary\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-283\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"19\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\" width=\"26\"/></a></em></strong>Upper and Lower Circuit – The exchange sets up a price band within which the stock can be traded on a given trading day. The highest price the stock can reach on the day is the upper circuit limit, and the lowest price is the lower circuit limit. The limit for a stock is set to 2%, 5%, 10%, or 20% based on the exchange’s selection criteria. The exchange places these restrictions to control excessive volatility when a stock reacts to certain news related to the company. The criteria (in terms of exchange restriction) changes for derivatives stocks (and index); more on that later.</p>\n<p><strong><em><strong><em><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\"><img alt=\"glossary\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-283\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"19\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\" width=\"26\"/></a> </em></strong></em></strong>Long Position – Long position or going long is a reference to the direction of your trade. For example, if you have bought or intend to buy Biocon shares, you are long on Biocon or planning to go long on Biocon, respectively. If you have bought the Nifty Index with an expectation that the index will trade higher, you have a long position on Nifty. You are considered bullish if you are long on a stock or an index.</p>\n<p><strong><em><strong><em><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\"><img alt=\"glossary\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-283\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"19\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\" width=\"26\"/></a> </em></strong></em></strong>Short Position – Going short or ‘shorting’ is a term used to describe a transaction carried out in a particular order. This is a slightly tricky concept. To help you understand the concept of shorting, I’d like to narrate an old incident at work; this happened around mid-2014, if I remember right.</p>\n<p>If you are a gadget enthusiast like me, you would probably recollect that Xiaomi (a Chinese manufacturer of smartphones) entered into an exclusive partnership with Flipkart to sell their flagship smartphone model called Mi3 in India. The price of Mi3 was speculated to be around Rs.14,000/-. If one wished to buy Mi3, he/she had to be a registered Flipkart user as the phone was not available for a non-registered user, and the registration was open only for a short time. I had promptly registered to buy the phone, but my colleague Rajesh had not. Though he wanted to buy the phone, he could not because he had not registered on time.</p>\n<p>Out of sheer desperation, Rajesh walked up to me and made an offer. He said he would buy the phone from me at Rs. 16,500/-. As a trader at heart, I readily agreed to sell him the phone! I even demanded he pays me the money right away.</p>\n<p>After I pocketed the money, I thought to myself, what have I done?? Look at the situation I’ve put myself into. I’ve sold a phone to Rajesh, which I don’t own yet!!</p>\n<p>But then, it was not a bad deal after all. I agree I had sold a phone that I didn’t own. However, I could always buy the phone on Flipkart and pass the new, unopened box to Rajesh. My only fear in this transaction was, what if the phone price is above Rs.16,500?? In that case, I’d make a loss and regret entering into this transaction with Rajesh. For example, if the phone were priced at Rs.18,000, my loss would be Rs.1,500 (18,000 – 16,500).</p>\n<p>However, to my luck, as expected, the phone was priced at Rs.14,000/-, I promptly bought it on Flipkart, and upon delivery, I handed over the phone to Rajesh, and in the whole process, I made a clean profit of Rs.2,500/- (16500 – 14000)!</p>\n<p>If you look at the transaction sequence, I first sold the phone (that I didn’t own) to Rajesh, then bought it later on Flipkart and delivered it to Rajesh. I sold it first and bought it later!</p>\n<p>This type of transaction is called a ‘Short Trade.’</p>\n<p>The concept of shorting is very counter-intuitive to normal humans because we are not used to ‘shorting’ in our day-to-day activity unless we have a trader mentality 🙂</p>\n<p>Going back to stock markets, think about this straightforward transaction – on day 1, you buy Wipro shares at Rs.405, two days later (day 3), the stock moves, and you sell your shares at Rs.425. You made a profit of Rs.20/- on this transaction.</p>\n<p>In this transaction, your first leg was to buy Wipro at Rs.405, the second leg was to sell Wipro at Rs.425, and you were bullish on the stock.</p>\n<p>On day 4, the stock is trading at Rs.425, and you are now bearish. You are convinced that the stock will go back to Rs.405. Is there a way you can profit from your bearish expectation? You could, and it can be done by shorting the stock.</p>\n<p>You sell the stock at Rs.425, and 2 days later, assuming the stock trades at Rs.405, you repurchase it.</p>\n<p>If you realize the trade’s first leg was to sell at Rs.425, and the second leg was to buy the stock at Rs.405. This is always the case with shorting – you first sell at a price you perceive as high to buy it back at a lower price later.</p>\n<p>You have executed the same trade as buying at Rs.405 and selling at Rs.425 but in reverse order.</p>\n<p>An obvious question you may have is – How can one sell Wipro shares without owning them? You can do so, just like I sold a phone I did not own. So shorting is possible in the stock markets. The important point to remember is that when you short a stock, you must ensure that you buy back the stock the same day before the market closes. Of course, you can short a stock in the derivatives segment and carry forward the position for a few days. But at this point, ignore the derivatives bit and understand that all short positions in stocks (also called cash segment) have to be closed before the market closes. In other words, a short position in the cash market works only on an intraday basis.</p>\n<p>To sum it all up…</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>When you short, you have a bearish view of the stock. You profit if the stock price goes down. After you short, if the stock price goes up, you will end up making a loss.</li>\n<li>When you short a stock, ensure you buy the stock back the same day before the market closes unless you use derivatives to short.</li>\n<li>Shorting a stock is easy – you select the stock you wish to short and click on sell.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To summarize long and short positions…</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Position</th>\n<th>1st Leg</th>\n<th>2nd Leg</th>\n<th>Expectation</th>\n<th>Make money when</th>\n<th>You will lose money if</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Long</td>\n<td>Buy</td>\n<td>Sell</td>\n<td>Bullish</td>\n<td>Stock goes up</td>\n<td>Stock price drops</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Short</td>\n<td>Sell</td>\n<td>Buy</td>\n<td>Bearish</td>\n<td>Stock goes down</td>\n<td>Stock price goes up</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Alright, let’s continue our discussion on commonly used stock market jargon.</p>\n<p><strong><em><strong><em><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\"><img alt=\"glossary\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-283\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"19\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/glossary.png\" width=\"26\"/></a> </em></strong></em></strong>Square off ­– Square off is a term used to indicate that you intend to close an existing position.

Here you are merely closing an existing long position!</p>\n<p>Squaring off a position means repurchasing the stock when you are short on the stock.

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>9.1 – Trading Terminal</h2>\n<p>Over the last few chapters, we have understood several things related to the stock markets. It is time for us to figure out how one can actually transact in the stock markets. There are three options available for you to place a transaction in the stock market –</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Call your stocks broker (usually on the central support number), and request to buy or sell a stock; this is called “Call &amp; Trade.”</li>\n<li>Use a web application</li>\n<li>Use a mobile application</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Regardless of which method you choose, the selected method gives you access to the stock market. Think of this access as a gateway. The gateway allows you to do multiple things, such as transact in shares, track your Profit &amp; Loss, track market movements, manage your funds, view stock charts, access trading tools, etc. This chapter aims to familiarize you with this gateway, also called a ‘Trading terminal’. To explain this chapter, I’ll use Zerodha’s trading terminal called ‘Kite.’ If you are with another broker, then the trading terminal provided to you will have (should have) similar features and functionality.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Ch-9-title.jpg\"><img alt=\"Ch-9-title\" class=\"size-full wp-image-358 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Ch-9-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Ch-9-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Ch-9-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></h2>\n<p>You can access the trading terminal by entering the URL on your browser.  For Zerodha Kite, it is kite.zerodha.com.  To access the trading terminal, you must have a trading account with your broker. A good trading terminal offers many features. We will start by understanding a few basic features. Let us set two basic tasks, and we will accomplish them using the trading terminal, and in the process, we learn the basics practically. Here are the two tasks –</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Buy one share of ITC, and</li>\n<li>Track the price of Infosys</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While we achieve the above two tasks, we will also learn about all the relevant concepts.</p>\n<h2><strong>9.2 – The login process</strong></h2>\n<p>The trading terminal is quite sensitive as it contains information about all your securities and funds. SEBI has been working hard to ensure the relevant regulations are in place to prevent situations where access to the client’s trading terminal is compromised. To ensure adequate security, brokers have to follow a stringent login process. The process involves entering your broker-provided user ID (it’s referred to as the Kite ID in Zerodha), and a password.</p>\n<p>Once you click login, the user id and password are authenticated, and then you are prompted to enter an external TOTP (Time based one-time password). TOTPs, as the name suggests, are time sensitive and keep changing once in a few seconds.  TOTPs can be set up using 3rd party authentication software like Google authenticator or Authy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M1C9_loginupdated.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14173\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"324\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M1C9_loginupdated-300x162.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M1C9_loginupdated-300x162.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M1C9_loginupdated-1024x554.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M1C9_loginupdated-768x415.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M1C9_loginupdated.png 1054w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>Once you validate the TOTP, you will instantly get access to your trading account. I’d encourage you to <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/z-connect/tradezerodha/kite/two-factor-authentication-2fa\">read this article</a> to learn about TOTP, the general login process, and the need to safeguard your trading account.</p>\n<h2><strong>9.3 – The Market watch</strong></h2>\n<p>Once you successfully log in to the platform, you must populate the ‘market watch’ with the stocks you are interested in. Think about the market watch as a blank slate. Once the stock is loaded on the market watch, you can easily transact and query information about it. A blank market watch looks like this (this is also the screen that you see once you log in)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_127-1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4631 size-large\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"499\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_127-1-1024x499.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_127-1-1024x499.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_127-1-300x146.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_127-1-768x374.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_127-1.png 1350w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>The 600.2 under equity and 136.75 under commodities indicate my fund balance. So 600 Rupees for Equity (to buy and sell stocks), and 136 Rupees to buy commodities. You can add funds from your bank to your trading account or withdraw funds from your trading account back to your bank account by clicking on the fund tab on top.</p>\n<p>Alright, let us work on the first task, i.e., to buy one share of ITC. As a first step, we will load ITC Ltd onto the market watch. To do this, we have to search for ITC in the search bar, and the drop-down will show the stock in different exchanges(NSE/BSE).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_128.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4617 size-medium\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"160\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_128-300x160.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_128-300x160.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_128.png 400w\" width=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p>You only need to look for ‘ITC’; other instruments, like ITC-BE, ITC-BL, or ITC6, are all different instruments. We will discuss more of that later. We are interested in buying one share of ITC (or ITC stock), and the relevant instrument is ITC. So let us click on the ‘Add symbol’ to add the stock to the Market Watch</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_7-1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4634 size-medium\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_7-1-300x149.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_7-1-300x149.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_7-1.png 397w\" width=\"300\"/></a>The Marketwatch will display the last traded price, a percentage change of the stock.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The last traded price of the stock (LTP) – This gives us a sense of how much the stock is trading at the very moment.</li>\n<li>Percentage change – This indicates the percentage change in the LTP with respect to the previous day’s close.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some basic information that will be needed at this point would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The previous day’s close – As the name suggests, it’s the previous day’s close price.</li>\n<li>OHLC – Open, High, Low, and Close give us a sense of the range within which the stock is trading during the day.

If you hover over the stock name from the left, you will find Buy, Sell, Market Depth, and chart options. If you click on Marketdepth, you will find the above information, including the best bid and offer price ladder. We will cover the Bid and Offer prices soon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_131.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4620 size-medium\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_131-268x300.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_131-268x300.png 268w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_131.png 400w\" width=\"268\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, the last traded price of ITC is Rs.262.25, and it is trading -0.40% lower than the previous day’s close, which was Rs.263.30. The open for the day was at Rs.265.90, the highest price and the lowest price at which the stock traded for the day was Rs.265.90 and Rs.262.15 respectively. The volume for the day is close to 27 lakh shares.</p>\n<h2><strong>9.4 – Buying stock through the trading terminal</strong></h2>\n<p>Our goal is to buy one share of ITC. We now have ITC in our trading terminal. The first step for this process would be to invoke what is called a buy order form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Hover over the stock you want to Buy and click on the Buy Icon (B)</li>\n<li>Clicking on the Buy icon invokes the buy order form, as seen below</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_133.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4621\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"191\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_133.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_133.png 549w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_133-300x143.png 300w\" width=\"400\"/></a></p>\n<p>The order form is pre-populated with some information like the price and quantity. We need to modify this as per our requirements. Let us begin with the first drop-down option on the top. By default, the exchange specified would be NSE, but you can select BSE if you wish.</p>\n<p>The next entry is the ‘order type.’ By clicking on the drop-down menu, you will see the following four options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Limit</li>\n<li>Market</li>\n<li>SL</li>\n<li>SL-Market</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let us understand what these options mean.</p>\n<p>You can opt for a ‘<strong>Limit</strong>’ order when you are particular about the price you want to pay for a stock. In our case, the last traded price of ITC is Rs.262.25 but say we want to limit our buy price to Rs.261, twenty-five paisa lower than the LTP. In such a situation, I can use the limit feature and specify the price at which I want to buy the stock. The limit feature is great as it gives us control over the price at which we want to buy, but on the flip side, if the stock price does not fall to our limit price, i.e., 261, our order will not get executed, and we won’t get to buy. This is one of the drawbacks of a limit order. The limit order stays valid till the market closes, i.e., 3:30 PM, and then gets canceled.</p>\n<p>You can also opt for a <strong>market order</strong> when you intend to buy at market-available prices instead of a limited price. So if you were to place a market order, as long as sellers are available, your order would go through, and ITC will be bought in and around Rs.262.25. Suppose the price goes up to Rs.265 coinciding with your market order placement, then you will get ITC at Rs.265. When you place a market order, you will never be sure of the price at which you will transact, which could be quite dangerous if you are an active trader. A market order will always ensure your order goes through, unlike a limit order.</p>\n<p><strong>A stop-loss order</strong> protects you from an adverse movement in the market after initiating a position. Suppose you buy ITC at Rs.262.25 with an expectation that ITC will hit Rs.275 shortly. But instead, what if the price of ITC starts going down? We can protect our position by defining the worst possible loss you are willing to take. For instance, in the example, let us assume you don’t want to take a loss beyond Rs.255</p>\n<p>This means you have gone long on ITC at Rs.262.25, and the maximum loss you will take on this trade is Rs.6 (255). If the stock price drops to Rs.255, the stop loss order gets active and hits the exchange, and you will be out of the loss-making position. If the price is above 255, the stop-loss order will be dormant.</p>\n<p>A stop-loss order is a passive order. To activate it, we need to enter a trigger price. A trigger price, usually above the stop-loss price, acts as a price threshold, and only after crossing this price does the stop-loss order transition from a passive order to an active order.</p>\n<p>Going with the above example:</p>\n<p>We are long at Rs.261. If the trade goes bad, we want to get rid of the position at Rs.255. Therefore 255 is the stop-loss price. The trigger price is specified so the stop-loss order would transition from passive to active. The trigger price has to be higher (or equal) to the stop-loss price. We can set this to Rs.255 or higher.  If the price drops below 255, the stop loss order gets active.</p>\n<p>Returning to the main buy order entry form, we move directly to the quantity once the order type is selected. Remember the task is to buy one share of ITC; hence we enter 1 in the quantity box. We ignore the trigger price and disclosed quantity for now. The next thing to select is the product type.</p>\n<p>Select CNC for delivery trades. If you intend to buy and hold the shares for multiple days/months/years, you must ensure the shares reside in your Demat account. Selecting CNC is your way of communicating this to your broker.</p>\n<p>Select MIS if you want to trade intraday. MIS is a margin product; we will understand more about this when we take up the derivatives module.</p>\n<p>Once these details are filled in your order form, the order is good to hit the markets. The order gets transmitted to the exchange as soon as you press the submit button on the order form. A unique order ticket number is generated against your order.</p>\n<p>Once the order is sent to the exchange, it will not get executed unless the price hits Rs.261. As soon as the price drops to Rs.261 (assuming sellers are willing to sell one share), your order gets through and is eventually executed. As soon as your order is executed, you will own one share of ITC.</p>\n<h2><strong>9.5 – The order book and Trade book</strong></h2>\n<p>Think of the order book and trade book as online registers within the trading terminal. The order book keeps track of all the orders you have sent to the exchange, and the trade book tracks all the trades. Think of it this way – when you order goods on Amazon, you first add items to the cart. The cart is the order book. You can add items, delete, or modify the order from the cart (order book). But when you press the buy button on Amazon, the order gets placed, and a receipt is generated. The trade book is that receipt. You also get a detailed receipt emailed to you called a ‘Contract Note’; we will discuss that later; for now think about the trade book as a general receipt for all the trades you carry out on the terminal.</p>\n<p>So the order book has all the details regarding your order. You can navigate to the order book by clicking the Orders tab.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_134.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4622 size-large\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"503\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_134-1024x503.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_134-1024x503.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_134-300x147.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_134-768x377.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_134.png 1350w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>The order book provides the details of the orders you have placed.

You can find the trade book just below the order book.</p>\n<p>Here is a snapshot of the trade book:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_138.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4626\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_138.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_138.png 903w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_138-300x60.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_138-768x155.png 768w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>The trade book confirms that the user ordered to buy one share of ITC at Rs 262.2. Also, notice a unique exchange order number is generated for the trade.</p>\n<p>So with this, our first task is complete!</p>\n<p>We now officially own one share of ITC. This share will reside in our DEMAT account until you decide to sell it.</p>\n<p>The next task is to track the price of Infosys. The first step would be to add Infosys to the market watch. We can do this by searching for Infosys in the search box.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_139.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4627 size-medium\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"182\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_139-300x182.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_139-300x182.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_139.png 401w\" width=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p>Once we select Infy, we press add to add it to the market watch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_141.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4629\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"368\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_141.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_141.png 399w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_141-245x300.png 245w\" width=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p>Notice we have two stocks on the watchlist now – Infy and ITC. We can now track live price information on Infosys. The last trade price is Rs.1014.75; the stock is down -0.11% from its previous day’s close of Rs.1015.85. Infosys opened the day at Rs.1014.80, making a low of Rs.998.40 and a high of Rs.1028.95. The volumes were 3.6 million shares.</p>\n<p>Please note while the open price will be fixed at Rs. 1014.80, the high and low prices change as and when the price of Infosys changes. For example, if Infosys moves from Rs.1014.2 to Rs.1050, the high price will reflect Rs. 1050 as the new high.</p>\n<p>Notice below that the LTP of Infosys is in green, and ITC is in red. The cell is highlighted in green if the current LTP is higher than the previous close, and red otherwise.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the snapshot below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_142.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4630 size-medium\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"184\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_142-300x184.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_142-300x184.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screenshot_142.png 402w\" width=\"300\"/></a></p>\n<p>While writing this chapter, the price of Infosys moved from 1014.20 to 1020.80, and the color changed to red from blue.</p>\n<p>Besides the basic information about the LTP, OHLC, and volume, we can also dig deeper to understand real-time market participation, which is available in market depth. I want to draw your attention to the blue and red numbers called the Bid and Offer prices.</p>\n<h2>9.6 – The Bid and Offer Price</h2>\n<p>If you want to buy a share, you need to buy it from a seller. The seller will offer the shares at a price that he or she thinks is fair. The price that the seller offers you is called the ‘<strong>Offer Price.’</strong> The offer price is highlighted in red. Let us analyze this in a bit more detail.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Offer Price</th>\n<th>Offer Quantity</th>\n<th>Number of Sellers</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>3294.80</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>3294.85</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>3295.00</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>3296.20</td>\n<td>25</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>3296.25</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>By default, the market depth window displays the top 5 bids and offer prices. In the table above, we have the top 5 offer prices.</p>\n<p>The first offer price is Rs.3294.80. At this particular moment, this is the best price to buy the stock and there are only two shares available at this price being offered by two different sellers (both of them are selling one share each). The next best price is Rs.3294.85. At this price, four shares are offered by two different sellers. The third best price is Rs.3295, at which eight shares are available, and two sellers offer this. So on and so forth.</p>\n<p>As you notice, the higher the asking price, the lower the priority. For example, the 5<sup>th</sup> position is an asking price of Rs.3296.25 for five shares. This is because the stock exchanges prioritize sellers willing to offer their shares at the lowest possible price.</p>\n<p>Notice that even if you want to buy ten shares at Rs.3294.8, you can only buy two shares because only two are being offered at Rs.3294.8. However, if you are not particular about the price (aka limit price), you can place a market order. When you place a market order to buy 10 shares, this is how it will go –</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Two shares are bought @ Rs.3294.8</li>\n<li>Four shares are bought @ Rs.3294.85</li>\n<li>Four shares are bought @ Rs.3295.00</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The ten shares will be bought at three different prices. Also, in the process, the LTP of Infosys will jump to Rs.3295 from Rs.3294.8</p>\n<p>If you want to sell a share, you need to sell it to a buyer willing to buy it from you. The buyer will buy the shares at a price that they thinks is fair. The price that the buyer expects is called the ‘bid price.’ The bid price is highlighted in blue. Let us analyze this part in a bit more detail:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Bid Price</th>\n<th>Bid Quantity</th>\n<th>Number of Buyers</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>3294.75</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>3294.20</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>3294.15</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>3293.85</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>3293.75</td>\n<td>125</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Again by default, the market depth window displays the top five bid prices. Notice the best price at which you can sell shares is Rs.3294.75, and at this price, you can only sell ten shares as only five buyers are willing to buy from you.</p>\n<p>If you were to sell 20 shares at market price, the following would be the execution pattern :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ten shares sold @ Rs.3294.75</li>\n<li>Six shares sold @ Rs.3294.20</li>\n<li>One share sold @ Rs.3294.15</li>\n<li>Three shares sold @ Rs.3293.85</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in a nutshell, the bid and offer prices give you information about the top 5 prices at which the buyers and sellers are stacked. You need to understand how buyers and sellers place their trades, especially if you are an intraday trader.</p>\n<p>By default, the bid-offer is shown only for the top 5 prices. You can, however, get an insight into the top 20 bids and offers by looking at the 20-depth window. I have discussed 20 in-depth details in the last chpater of this module.</p>\n<h2>9.7 – Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The trading terminal is your gateway to markets. The trading terminal has many features that are useful to traders. We will explore these features as we progress through the various learning modules. At this stage, you should know how to set up a market watch, transact (buy and sell) in stocks, view the order and trade book, and understand the market depth window.</p>\n<p>One last thing before we wind up this chapter – the trading terminal is continuously evolving to ensure the user experience is smooth. A few years down the lane, the UI/UX may have changed, but the concepts of the order book, trade book, SL, limit order, etc, will remain the same.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A trading terminal is your gateway to markets. You must know the operations of a trading terminal if you aspire to become an active trader.</li>\n<li>You can load the stock you are interested in on the market watch to track all the relevant information.</li>\n<li>Some basic information on a market watch is – LTP, % change, OHLC, and volumes.</li>\n<li>You must invoke a buy order form by pressing the ‘B’ key to buy a stock. Likewise, to sell a stock, you need to invoke a sell order form by pressing ‘S’ key.</li>\n<li>You choose a limit order type when you are keen on transacting at a particular price; else, you can opt for a market order.</li>\n<li>You choose CNC as the product type if you want to buy and hold the stock across multiple days.

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>10.1 – Market structure</h2>\n<p>The topic of clearing and settlement is super important to understand as it gives you a sense of the movement of money and funds between your account and, let’s just say, the stock market. For instance, when you buy a stock, say 100 shares of Marico, you need to clearly understand how long it takes for the broker to remit these 100 Marico shares to your Demat account. We can extend this to stock selling as well.</p>\n<p>The lack of understanding of the clearing and settlement process could leave a void and leave you with many unanswered questions related to the market structure. Hence, for this reason, we will explore what happens behind the scenes from when you buy a stock to when it hits your DEMAT account.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Ch10title.jpg\"><img alt=\"Ch10title\" class=\"size-full wp-image-363 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Ch10title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Ch10title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Ch10title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a>We will keep this discussion practical with a clear emphasis on what you need to know about clearing and settlement.</p>\n<h2>10.2 – What happens when you buy a stock?</h2>\n<p><em>Day 1 – The trade (T Day), Monday</em></p>\n<p>Assume on a Monday, you buy 100 shares of Reliance Industries at Rs.1,000/- per share. The total buy value is Rs.1,00,000/- (100 * 1000). The day you make the transaction is the trade date; brokers refer to this as the ‘T Day.’  The assumption is that you intend to hold Reliance Industries in your Demat account for a few days or maybe years, and it is not an intraday trade.</p>\n<p>When you place an order to buy, the broker quickly validates if you have the necessary funds. In this example, the order will go through only if you have Rs.1,00,000/- in your trading account; it will be rejected otherwise. Assuming the trade is executed through Zerodha, the applicable charges are –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Chargeable Item</th>\n<th>Applicable Charges</th>\n<th>Amount</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">01</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Brokerage</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Zero for Equity Delivery. For intraday, charges are 0.03% or Rs.20/- whichever is lower, per executed order</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Zero</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">02</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Security Transaction Charges(STT)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">0.1% of the turnover</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">100/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Exchange transaction Charges</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">0.00345% of the turnover</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">3.45/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">GST</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">18% of Brokerage + Transaction charges + SEBI charges</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">0.62/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">SEBI Charges</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Rs.10 per crore of transaction</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">0.12/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>104.19/-</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Additionally, Rs.15/- towards stamp duty is applicable. Stamp duty is charged at 0.015% on the buy side. Hence the total applicable charges are <strong>Rs.119.19</strong>. Note that these rates are subject to change; you can visit <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/brokerage-calculator/#tab-equities\">Zerodha’s Brokerage calculator</a> to figure out the exact applicable rate when you wish to carry out a transaction.</p>\n<p>So an amount of Rs.1,00,000 plus 119.19 totaling Rs.1,00,119.19/- is required to carry out this particular transaction. Remember, the money is blocked in your account when you place a trade, but the stock is yet to hit your DEMAT account.</p>\n<p>Also, on the T day, the broker generates a ‘contract note’ and emails you the copy to your registered email id.  A contract note is like a bill detailing all your daily transactions. You can save the contract note for future reference. A contract note gives you a break up of all daily transactions and the trade reference number. It also shows the breakup of charges charged by the broker.</p>\n<p><em>Day 2 – Trade Day + 1 (T+1 day, Tuesday)</em></p>\n<p>Starting January 2023, India became the first country to implement a T+1 settlement for all the scrips listed on the stock exchanges. Earlier when you used to buy the shares, these would be delivered to your demat account on T+2 day. For example, if you bought shares on Monday, these will be credited to your demat account only on Wednesday. With T+1 settlement, if you buy shares on Monday, they will be credited to your demat account on Tuesday, the next day itself.</p>\n<p>So on Day 2, also called T+1, the settlement is due to the exchange. Assuming the purchaser and seller are trading via two different brokers, the funds are debited from the buyer’s broker’s pool account by the clearing corporation and credited to the selling broker’s pool account. Also, on T+1 day, the shares will reflect in the purchaser’s DEMAT account, indicating that you own 100 shares of Reliance.</p>\n<h2>10.3 – What happens when you sell a stock?</h2>\n<p>The day you sell the stocks is again referred to as the ‘T Day’. The stock gets blocked when you sell the stock from your DEMAT account, and by the end of the day, the stocks are ‘earmarked’ for settlement. Please refer to the next section to learn more about earmarking.</p>\n<p>Before the T+1 day, the earmarked shares are delivered to the depository. On settlement day, the blocked shares are debited from your demat account and moved to the clearing corporation for payin. Against the debit of such shares, you’d have received a credit for the sale after deducting all charges. You may be interested to note that you will receive 80% of the funds on T-Day and the remaining 20% on T+1. In other words, the seller will be settled fully on a T+1 basis, just like how the buyer is settled.</p>\n<p>What transpires between T day and T+1 is a complex settlement process involving the stockbroker, clearing corporation, depository, and the stock exchange. Each entity uploads and receives multiple files to ensure the transaction goes smoothly. As far as you are concerned, you need to remember that equity transactions are settled on a T+1 basis, meaning, if you are a buyer, you will get the shares on T+1, and if you are a seller, the funds are credited on a T+1 basis.</p>\n<h2>10.4 – What is earmarking?</h2>\n<p>Earlier, for the settlement of a sell trade, the broker would be required to debit shares from a selling client, hold the securities in the broker’s pool account, and transfer the securities to the clearing corporation (CC) on T+2. Upon transfer, the client would receive a credit of funds against the sale, and the transaction would have been said to be settled. It was usual practice for brokers to debit shares on T day or T+1 day and transfer it to CC on T+2 (since the settlement was on T+2).</p>\n<p>From the time the shares were debited until they were settled, the client shares lie in the broker’s pool account, possibly allowing a broker to misuse these securities. SEBI identified this as a potential risk and introduced “earmarking” for settlement. In this new earmarking system, shares are no longer debited from the client’s account; they are only earmarked for settlement. Think of earmarking as a temporary hold on the securities towards an upcoming settlement for the sale transaction initiated by the client.</p>\n<p>On settlement day, the shares are debited from the investor’s account and credited to the clearing corporation. This new process eliminates the need for brokers to hold client shares in their pool account, thereby eliminating the risk that comes along. The new earmarking process has been made mandatory from November 2022.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The day you make a transaction, the trade date is referred to as the ‘T Day.’</li>\n<li>The broker must issue you a contract note for all transactions by the end of T day.</li>\n<li>When you buy a share, the same will be reflected in your DEMAT account by the end of T+1 day.</li>\n<li>All equity/stock settlements in India happen on a T+1 basis.</li>\n<li>When you sell shares, the shares are blocked immediately, and the sale proceeds are credited again on T+1 day.</li>\n<li>Earmarking of shares was introduced to ensure the securities don’t move out of the client’s demat account to the broker’s pool account.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

A corporate action is initiated by the board of directors and approved by the company’s shareholders.</p>\n<h2><img alt=\"dividend1\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-370\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dividend1.png\" width=\"131\"/>11.2 – Dividends</h2>\n<p>Dividends are portions of profits made by the company, which are distributed to the company’s shareholders. Dividends are paid on a per-share basis. For example, Infosys recently declared a dividend of Rs.42/- per share, which means you get Rs.42/- as dividend income for every share you own. Suppose you own 100 Infosys shares; you can get 100*42 = Rs.4,200/- as dividend income. The company directly remits the dividends to your bank account (linked to your Demat account). The dividend paid is also expressed as a percentage of the face value. In the above case, the face value of Infosys is Rs.5/-, and the dividend paid was Rs.42/- hence the dividend payout is said to be 840% (42/5).</p>\n<p>It is not mandatory to pay dividends every year. If the company feels that instead of paying dividends to shareholders, they are better off utilizing the same cash to fund a new project for a better future, they can do so. Typically, companies in the growth phase (young companies growing fast) choose not to pay dividends but rather to plow back the profits into the business for more growth. However, when the company’s growth opportunities slow down and it holds excess cash, it would make sense to reward its shareholders via dividends. Cash with shareholders makes more sense than retaining the cash on the company’s book, and distributing the dividends may be the best way forward for the company.</p>\n<p>The dividends need not be paid from the profits alone. If the company has made a loss during the year but it holds a healthy cash reserve, it can still pay dividends from its cash reserves.</p>\n<p>The company’s board members at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) decide whether to pay a dividend. The dividends are not paid right after the announcement. This is because the shares are traded throughout the year, and it would be difficult to identify who is eligible to receive dividends and who isn’t. The following timeline would help you understand the dividend cycle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ch11-diagram.png\"><img alt=\"ch11-diagram\" class=\"size-full wp-image-337 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"80\" sizes=\"(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ch11-diagram.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ch11-diagram.png 733w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ch11-diagram-300x33.png 300w\" width=\"733\"/></a></p>\n<p><em>Dividend Declaration Date:</em> This is the date on which the AGM takes place, and the company’s board approves the dividend issue</p>\n<p><em>Record Date:</em> The date the company decides to review the shareholder’s register to list all eligible shareholders for the dividend. Usually, the time difference between the dividend declaration date and the record date is 30 days.</p>\n<p><em>Ex-Date/Ex-Dividend date:</em> With the T+1 settlement cycle, the ex-dividend date normally is on the same day as the record date. Only shareholders who own the shares before the ex-dividend date are entitled to receive the dividend. This is because, in India, the equity settlement is on a T+1 basis. So for all practical purposes, if you want to be entitled to receive a dividend, you need to ensure you buy the shares before the ex-dividend date.</p>\n<p><em>Dividend Payout Date:</em> The date on which the dividends are paid to shareholders listed in the company register.</p>\n<p><em>Cum Dividend</em>: The shares are said to be cum dividends till the ex-dividend date.</p>\n<p>When the stock goes ex-dividend, usually, the stock drops to the extent of dividends paid. For example, if ITC (trading at Rs. 335) has declared a dividend of Rs.15. On ex-date, the stock price will drop to the extent of the dividend paid, and as in this case, the price of ITC will drop down to Rs.320. The reason for this price drop is that the dividend amount paid no longer sits on the company’s balance sheet; hence the stock price is adjusted. From the balance sheet perspective, dividends paid are considered cash out. Hence the new stock price has to factor in the shrunk balance sheet. Hence the price drops. That said, you will not always notice a significant price drop in the share price.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, the company pays out a special dividend. A special dividend is non-recurring and happens on a ‘one-time basis.’ The special dividends are usually very large payments compared to a regular dividend, and that’s when the stock price significantly drops. The drop in stock price should not be considered negative as you would receive a cash payment as a shareholder.</p>\n<p>Lastly, dividends can be paid anytime during the financial year. If it’s paid during the financial year, it is called the interim dividend. If the dividend is paid at the end of the financial year, it is called the final dividend.</p>\n<h2><img alt=\"bonus-issue\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-371\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bonus-issue.png\" width=\"131\"/>11.3 – Bonus Issue</h2>\n<p>A bonus issue is a stock dividend allotted by the company to reward the shareholders. In regular dividends, cash is paid out to shareholders, but in a bonus issue, stocks are paid out instead of cash. The bonus shares are issued out of the reserves of the company. The shareholders receive these free shares against shares they currently hold. These allotments typically come in a fixed ratio of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, etc. In a bonus issue, the stock price declines to the extent of the bonus ratio, but this decline should not be mistaken for a correction in stock price or a fall.</p>\n<p>If the ratio is 2:1, the existing shareholders get two additional shares for every share they hold at no additional cost. So if a shareholder owns 100 shares, 200 additional shares will be rewarded. The total holding after the bonus issue will become 300 shares. When the bonus shares are issued, the number of shares the shareholder holds will increase, but an investment’s overall value will remain the same.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this, let us assume a bonus issue on different ratios – 1:1, 3:1 and 5:1</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Bonus Issue</th>\n<th>No. of shares held before bonus.</th>\n<th>Share price before Bonus issue</th>\n<th>Value of Investment</th>\n<th>No. of shares post Bonus.</th>\n<th>Share price after Bonus issue</th>\n<th>Value of Investment</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1:1</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>75</td>\n<td>7,500</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>37.5</td>\n<td>7500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3:1</td>\n<td>30</td>\n<td>550</td>\n<td>16,500</td>\n<td>120</td>\n<td>137.5</td>\n<td>16,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5:1</td>\n<td>2000</td>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>30,000</td>\n<td>12,000</td>\n<td>2.5</td>\n<td>30,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So as you see, in a bonus issue, only the number of shares increases, and your investment value remains the same before and after the bonus issue.</p>\n<p>The bonus announcement date, ex-bonus date, and record date are similar to the dividend issue.</p>\n<p>Companies issue bonus shares to encourage retail participation, especially when the company’s price per share is very high, and it becomes tough for new investors to buy shares. The number of outstanding shares increases by issuing bonus shares, but the share price is slashed, as shown in the example above.</p>\n<p>Think about this – fewer retail participants can buy or sell that share if the share price is bloated (I mean just the per-share price here, not the valuation). For example, the share price of MRF Limited is in the region of Rs.90,000 per share. A retail investor has to shell out 90K to buy and invest in 1 share, and this also means a small retail investor, with, say, Rs.25,000 to invest, can never buy MRF. Many retail investors spread the risk across 100s and 1000s of investors as opposed to a few investors. Hence, when the stock price bloats, companies issue a bonus share to slash the stock price without impacting any other financial metric, which is one reason to issue a bonus share.</p>\n<p>Why isn’t MRF splitting the shares, then? Well, at the end of the day, the decision is solely dependent on the company and I guess MRF is yet to make up their mind or perhaps they just wont indulge in these corporate actions 🙂</p>\n<h2><img alt=\"stocksplit\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-399\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/stocksplit.png\" width=\"131\"/>11.4 – Stock Split</h2>\n<p>The word stock split sounds weird, but this happens regularly in the markets. What this means is quite literally – the stocks that you hold are split!</p>\n<p>Similar to a bonus issue, when the company declares a stock split, the number of shares held increases, but the investment value remains the same. The big difference between a bonus and a split is that in the bonus issue, the face value of the company remains unchanged, but in a stock split, the face value changes. Suppose the stock’s face value is Rs.10, and there is a 1:2 stock split, then the face value will change to Rs.5. If you owned one share before the split, you would now own two shares after the split.</p>\n<p>We will illustrate this with an example:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Split Ratio</th>\n<th>Old FV</th>\n<th>No. of shares you own before split</th>\n<th>Share Price before split</th>\n<th>Investment Value before split</th>\n<th>New FV</th>\n<th>No. of shares you own after the split</th>\n<th>Share Price after the split</th>\n<th>Investment value after the split</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1:2</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>900</td>\n<td>90,000</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>450</td>\n<td>90,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1:5</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>900</td>\n<td>90,000</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>180</td>\n<td>90,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Like a bonus issue, a stock split encourages more retail participation by reducing the value per share. The dates and timeline (announcement date, ex-date, record date, etc.) are similar to dividend and bonus issues.</p>\n<h2><img alt=\"rightissue1\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-396\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rightissue1.png\" width=\"131\"/>11.5 – Rights Issue</h2>\n<p>The idea behind a rights issue is to raise fresh capital. However, instead of going public, the company approaches its existing shareholders. Think about the rights issue as a second IPO and a select group of people (existing shareholders). The rights issue <strong>could indicate</strong> promising new development in the company, but this is not always true. As an investor, you need to evaluate the reasons for the right issue and determine if it makes sense. The shareholders can subscribe to the rights issue in the proportion of their shareholding. For example, 1:4 rights issue means for every four shares; the shareholder can subscribe to 1 additional share. The new shares under the rights issue will be issued at a lower price than what prevails in the markets. For example, if a stock is trading at Rs.500 per share, then the right issue could be at a 20% discount, at Rs.400 per share.</p>\n<p>However, a word of caution – The investor should not be swayed by the company’s discount, but they should look beyond that. A rights issue is different from a bonus issue as one is paying money to acquire shares. Hence the shareholder should subscribe only if he or she is completely convinced about the company’s future. It can so happen that after the company announces the right issue, the stock price can go below the right issue price. If the market price is below the subscription price/right issue price, it is cheaper to buy it from the open market.</p>\n<h2><img alt=\"buyback\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-398\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/buyback.png\" width=\"131\"/>11.6 – Buyback of shares</h2>\n<p>A buyback can be seen as a company’s method to invest in itself by buying shares from other investors in the market. Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding in the market; however, the buyback of shares is an important corporate restructuring method. There could be many reasons why corporates choose to buy back shares…</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Improve the profitability on a per-share basis</li>\n<li>To consolidate their stake in the company.</li>\n<li>To prevent other companies from taking over.</li>\n<li>To show the confidence of the promoters about their company.</li>\n<li>To support the share price from declining in the markets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When a company announces a buyback, it signals the company’s confidence in itself. Hence this is usually positive for the share price, but like other things in the market, always evaluate the reasons for the corporate action.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Corporate actions have an impact on stock prices.</li>\n<li>Dividends are a means of rewarding shareholders.

Outside events, both economic and/or non-economic, impact stocks and the market’s performance in general. It is also important to understand the events that influence the markets.</p>\n<p>In this chapter, we will try to understand some common events and how the stock market reacts to these events.</p>\n<h2>12.2 – Monetary Policy</h2>\n<p>The monetary policy is a tool through which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) controls the money supply by controlling the interest rates. RBI is India’s central bank. Likewise, every country’s central bank is responsible for setting interest rates. For example, the European Central Bank in Europe and Federal Reserves in the US. Central Banks tweak the interest rates to control the money supply in the mainstream economy.</p>\n<p>While setting the interest rates, the RBI has to strike a balance between growth and inflation. In a nutshell – if the interest rates are high, the borrowing rates are high (particularly for corporations). If corporate can’t borrow easily, they cannot grow. If corporations don’t grow, the economy slows down.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, borrowing becomes easier when the interest rates are low. This translates to more money in the hands of corporations and consumers. With more money, there is increased spending which means the sellers tend to increase the prices of goods and services, leading to inflation.</p>\n<p>I’d encourage you to watch this YouTube video where I’ve tried to explain what causes inflation and the means through which RBI controls inflation.</p>\n<p><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qx3YMdcLTZo?list=PLX2SHiKfualEyD05J9JsklEq1JFGbG6qJ\" title=\"What is inflation and what causes it?\" width=\"500\"></iframe></p>\n<p>To strike a balance, the RBI has to consider all economic factors and carefully set the key rates. Any imbalance in these rates can lead to economic chaos. The key RBI rates that you need to track are as follows:</p>\n<p><em>Repo Rate </em>– Banks can borrow from the RBI. The rate at which RBI lends money to other banks is called the Repo Rate. If the repo rate is high, the cost of borrowing is high, leading to slow economic growth. You can check the latest repo rate (And other rates, too) on RBI’s <a href=\"https://www.rbi.org.in/\">website</a>. Markets don’t like the RBI increasing the repo rates because it slows down economic growth.</p>\n<p><em>Reverse repo rate</em> – Reverse Repo rate is the rate at which RBI borrows money from banks. Or in other words, Reverse Repo is the deposit rate RBI offers to other banks when the banks park funds with RBI. When banks deposit money to RBI, they are certain that RBI will not default, so the rate RBI offers is relatively low. However, the banking system’s money supply reduces when banks deposit money with RBI (at a lower rate) instead of the corporate entity. An increase in the reverse repo rate is not great for the economy as it tightens the money supply. Sometimes via the central bank’s policy, the central bank mandates higher deposits by banks; again, this is a way to curtail excess money supply in the mainstream economy.</p>\n<p><em>Cash reserve ratio (CRR) – </em>Every bank must maintain funds with RBI. The amount that they maintain is dependent on the CRR. If CRR increases, more money is sucked out of the mainstream economy, which is not good for the economy.</p>\n<p>The monetary policy committee members meet regularly to review the economic situation and decide upon these key rates; hence keeping track of the monetary policy event is a must for any active trader. The first to react to rate decisions would be interest-rate sensitive stocks across various sectors such as – banks, automobiles, housing finance, real estate, metals, etc.</p>\n<h2>12.3 – Inflation</h2>\n<p>Inflation is a sustained increase in the general prices of goods and services. Increasing inflation erodes the purchasing power of money. All things being equal, if the cost of 1 KG of onion has increased from Rs.15 to Rs.20, this price increase is attributed to inflation. Inflation is inevitable, but a high inflation rate is not desirable as it could lead to economic uneasiness. A high level of inflation tends to send a bad signal to markets. Both the Government and RBI work towards reducing inflation to a manageable level. Inflation is generally measured using an index. If the inflation index increases by certain percentage points, it indicates rising inflation. Likewise, an index falling indicates inflation cooling off.</p>\n<p>There are two inflation indices – The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI).</p>\n<p><em>Wholesale Price Index (WPI)</em> – The WPI indicates the movement in prices at the wholesale level. It captures the price change when goods are bought and sold wholesale. WPI is an easy and convenient method to calculate inflation. The inflation measured here is at an institutional level and does not necessarily capture the consumer’s inflation.</p>\n<p><em>Consumer Price Index</em> <em>(CPI)</em>– The CPI, on the other hand, captures the effect of the change in prices at a retail level. As a consumer, CPI inflation is what matters. The calculation of CPI is quite detailed as it involves classifying consumption into various categories and subcategories across urban and rural regions. Each of these categories is made into an index, the final CPI index is a composition of several internal indices. The CPI captures the effect of inflation on daily household consumables like fruits, vegetables, cereals, and even fuels like petrol and diesel.</p>\n<p>The computation of CPI is quite rigorous and detailed. It is one of the most critical metrics for studying the economy.  A national statistical agency, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI), publishes the CPI numbers around the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of every month. The RBI’s challenge is to strike a balance between inflation and interest rates. Usually, a low-interest rate tends to increase inflation, and a high-interest rate tends to arrest inflation.</p>\n<h2>12.4 – Index of Industrial Production (IIP)</h2>\n<p>The Index of Industrial Production (IIP)  is a short-term indicator of the country’s industrial sector’s progress. The data is released every month (along with inflation data) by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI). As the name suggests, the IIP measures the Indian industrial sectors’ production, keeping a fixed reference point. As of today, India uses the reference point of 2004-05. The reference point is also called the base year.</p>\n<p>Roughly about 15 different industries submit their production data to the ministry, which collates the data and releases it as an index number. If the IIP increases, it indicates a vibrant industrial environment (as the production is going up) and hence a positive sign for the economy and markets. A decreasing IIP indicates a sluggish production environment, hence a negative sign for the economy and markets.</p>\n<p>To sum up, an upswing in industrial production is good for the economy, and a downswing rings an alarm. As India is getting more industrialized, the relative importance of the Index of Industrial Production is increasing.</p>\n<p>A lower IIP number puts pressure on the RBI to lower the interest rates and aid industrial credit with cheaper credit.</p>\n<h2>12.5 – Purchasing Managers Index (PMI)</h2>\n<p>The Purchasing managers’ index (PMI) is an economic indicator that tries to capture business activity across the country’s manufacturing and service sectors. This is a survey-based indicator where the respondents – usually the purchasing managers- indicate their business perception change concerning the previous month. A separate survey is conducted for the service and manufacturing sectors. The data from the survey are consolidated on a single index. Typical areas covered in the survey include new orders, output, business expectations, and employment.</p>\n<p>The PMI number usually oscillates around 50. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, and below 50 indicates a contraction in the economy. And reading at 50 indicates no change in the economy.</p>\n<h2>12.6 – Budget</h2>\n<p>A Budget is an event during which the Ministry of Finance discusses the country’s finance in detail. The Finance Minister, on behalf of the ministry, makes a budget presentation to the entire country. During the budget, major policy announcements and economic reforms are announced, which impacts various industries across the markets. Therefore the budget plays a vital role in the economy.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this further, in one of the recent budgets, the expectation was to increase the duties on a cigarette. As expected, during the budget, the Finance Minister raised the duties on a cigarette, so the prices increased. An increased cigarette price has a few implications:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Increased cigarette prices discourage smokers from buying cigarettes (needless to say, this is debatable), and hence the profitability of the cigarette manufacturing companies such as ITC decreases. If the profitability decreases, investors may want to sell shares of ITC.</li>\n<li>If market participants start selling ITC, the markets will come down because ITC is an index heavyweight.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In reaction to the budget announcement, ITC traded 3.5% lower for this precise reason.</p>\n<p>A budget is an annual event, and it is announced during the last week of February. However, the budget announcement could be delayed under certain special circumstances, such as a new government formation.</p>\n<h2>12.7 – Corporate Earnings Announcement</h2>\n<p>Corporate earning season is perhaps one of the important events to which the stocks react. The listed companies (trading on the stock exchange) must declare their earnings once every quarter, also called the quarterly earnings numbers. During an earnings announcement, the corporate gives out details on various operational activities, including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Revenue growth</li>\n<li>Expense trend</li>\n<li>Finance charges</li>\n<li>Profitability trends</li>\n<li>Project updates</li>\n<li>Key trends in the industry</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Besides, some companies give an overview of what to expect from the upcoming quarters. This forecast is called ‘corporate guidance.’</p>\n<p>Invariably every quarter, the first blue-chip company to make the quarterly announcement is Infosys Limited. They also give out guidance regularly. Market participants follow what Infosys has to say regarding guidance as it impacts the markets.</p>\n<p>The table below gives you an overview of the earning season in India:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Months</th>\n<th>Quarter</th>\n<th>Result Announcement</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>April to June</td>\n<td>Quarter 1 (Q1)</td>\n<td>1st week of July</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>July to September</td>\n<td>Quarter 2 (Q2)</td>\n<td>1st week of Oct</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>October to December</td>\n<td>Quarter 3 (Q3)</td>\n<td>1st Week of Jan</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>January to March</td>\n<td>Quarter 4 (Q4)</td>\n<td>1st Week of April</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Do note that the 1st of April in India marks the beginning of the financial year. In the US, the financial year starts on 1st Jan, so the first quarter starts from January through March, and so forth.</p>\n<p>Every quarter when the company declares its earnings, the market participants match the earnings with their expectations of how much the company should have earned. The market participant’s expectation is called the ‘street expectation.’</p>\n<p>The stock price will react positively if the company’s earnings are better than the street expectations. The stock price will react negatively if the actual numbers are lower than the street expectation.</p>\n<p>If the street expectation and actual numbers match, the stock price tends to trade flat with a negative bias more often than not. This is mainly because the company could not give any positive surprises.</p>\n<h2>12.8 – Non Financial events</h2>\n<p>Apart from the events we discussed above, it would be best to watch out for other non-financial events to understand their impact on markets. For example, the Covid crisis of 2020 had a significant effect on economies around the world, disrupting the world economic order. The supply chain took a hit across the globe leading to an inflation spike. That said, there were select pockets of the economy that did very well, mainly the online services industry.</p>\n<p>Events like the Russia – Ukraine war or the tension between China and Taiwan have impacted world markets. Geo-political affairs such as these impact various connected economies. For instance, the war between Russia and Ukraine affects the supply of natural gas and crude oil, which significantly impacts the energy costs in Europe.</p>\n<p>As an active trader or a market participant, you need to watch out for these events and understand how these events can impact the markets.</p>\n<p>While the world economies are interconnected, isolated events (Country specific) impact the local economy. For example, the elections in India impact only the Indian economy.</p>\n<p>So, keep an eye on these non-financial events and how they can impact the stock markets or sometimes specific industries.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Key takeaways from this chapter</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Markets and individual stocks react to events. Market participants should equip themselves to understand and decipher these events.</li>\n<li>Monetary policy is one of the most important economic events. During the monetary policy, review actions on a repo, reverse repo, CRR etc. are initiated.</li>\n<li>Interest rates and inflation are related. Increasing interest rates curbs inflation and vice versa</li>\n<li>Inflation data is released every month by MOSPI. As a consumer, CPI inflation data is what you need to track.</li>\n<li>IIP measures industrial production activity. An increase in IIP cheers the markets, and a lower IIP disappoints the market.</li>\n<li>PMI is a survey-based business sentiment indicator. The PMI number oscillates around 50 marks. Above 50 is good news to markets, and PMI below 50 is not.</li>\n<li>The Budget is an important market event where policy announcements and reform initiatives are taken. Markets and stocks react strongly to budget announcements.</li>\n<li>Corporate earnings are reported every quarter. Stocks react mainly due to the variance in actual number versus the street’s expectation.</li>\n<li>Keep an eye on non-financial events and how they can impact the markets.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

If you’ve read all the chapters and scrolled through the numerous comments in each chapter, then that means that you dont have a passing interest in stock markets but rather a genuine interest to learn and profit from the market.</p>\n<p>I guess you are now warmed up to dig deeper!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ch-13title.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5800 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ch-13title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ch-13title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ch-13title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a>The objective of the first module is to give you a quick hands-on introduction to the stock markets. In our endeavor to introduce the stock markets, we have carefully selected concepts you need to know, especially if you are new to markets.  At this point, it is a good sign if you have many unanswered questions. You will find your answers as we proceed to other modules.</p>\n<p>Before we proceed further, you need to understand why we have so many different learning modules and how these modules are interrelated. Here are some of the modules that we will cover in Varsity.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction to Stock Markets</li>\n<li>Technical analysis</li>\n<li>Fundamental Analysis</li>\n<li>Futures Trading</li>\n<li>Option Theory</li>\n<li>Option Strategies</li>\n<li>Markets &amp; Taxation</li>\n<li>Currency, Commodity, and Govt Securities</li>\n<li>Risk Management &amp; Trading Philosophy</li>\n<li>Trading Systems</li>\n<li>Personal Finance (Mutual Funds)</li>\n<li>Integrated Financial Modelling</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Apart from these, we will add other modules on the go.</p>\n<h2>13.2 – So many modules, how are they interrelated?</h2>\n<p>The idea of ‘Varsity at Zerodha’ is to create a repository of high-quality market-related educational content. The content will cover fundamental analysis, technical analysis, derivatives, trading strategies, risk management, financial modeling, etc. Each main topic is categorized as a module. So think of a module as reading a book with several chapters within.</p>\n<p>You may wonder how each topic fits within the grand scheme. To help you get a perspective, let me ask you a question. To be successful in the markets, what, according to you, is the <strong>single most important factor?</strong> Success in markets is easily defined – if you make money consistently, you are successful, and if you don’t, you are not!</p>\n<p>So if you were to answer this question for me, chances are you would think about risk management, discipline, market timing, access to information, etc., as the key to success in markets. While one cannot deny the importance of these factors, developing a point of view (POV) is even more compelling and primary.</p>\n<p>A point of view is the art of developing a sense of direction on a stock or the index. If you think the stock is going up, your POV is bullish; hence you would be a buyer of the stock. Likewise, if you think a stock is going down, your POV is bearish; you would be a stock seller. Without a POV, you won’t know what to do in the market. Once you develop a POV, you add other elements like risk management, timing, macro &amp; micro factors, etc., to improve the odds of your trade, but without a POV, you just can’t get started. For that reason, I’d consider developing POV as the most important factor.</p>\n<p>Having said that, how do you develop a point of view? How do you figure out if the stock is going up or down?</p>\n<p>One needs to develop a systematic approach to analyze the markets to develop a point of view. A few methods are using which you can figure out/ analyze what to buy or sell. They are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fundamental Analysis (FA)</li>\n<li>Technical Analysis (TA)</li>\n<li>Quantitative Analysis (QA)</li>\n<li>Outside views</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To give you a preview, here is a typical illustration of a trader’s thought process while developing a POV (whether to buy or sell stocks) based on a particular method of analysis –</p>\n<p><strong>FA-based POV</strong> – The company’s quarterly numbers look impressive. The company has reported a 25% top-line and 15% bottom-line growth. The company’s guidance also looks positive. With all the fundamental factors aligned, the stock looks bullish; hence the stock is a buy.</p>\n<p><strong>TA-based POV – </strong>The MACD indicator has turned bullish along with a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern; the stock is also trading at its support point, with that study, its short-term sentiment looks positive; therefore, the stocks are a buy.</p>\n<p><strong>QA-based POV – </strong>With the recent up move, the stock’s price to earnings (PE) touched the 3<sup>rd</sup> standard deviation. There is only a 1% chance for the PE to breach the 3<sup>rd</sup> standard deviation. Hence, it is prudent to expect a reversion to mean the stock is a sell.</p>\n<p><strong>Outside view – </strong>The analyst on TV recommends a buy on the stock; therefore, the stock is a buy.</p>\n<p>The POV you take should always be based on your own analysis rather than an outsider’s view, as more often than not, one regrets taking action based on an outside view.</p>\n<p>So after developing a POV, what does one generally do? Does the straightaway go and trade the point of view? Here is where the complexity of markets starts to kick in.</p>\n<p>If the POV is bullish, you can choose to do one of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy the stock in the spot market.</li>\n<li>Buy the stock in the derivatives markets.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Within derivatives, you can choose to buy the futures.</li>\n<li>Or choose to trade via the options market.\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>Within the options market, there are call options and put options.</li>\n<li>You can combine call and put options to create a synthetic bullish trade.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So what you choose to do after developing a POV is a different ball game.  Choosing the right instrument to trade that complements your POV is critical to profitable trading.</p>\n<p>For example, if I’m extremely bullish on the stock from a 1-year perspective, I’m better off making a delivery trade. However, if I’m out rightly bullish on the stock from a short-term perspective (say one week), I’d rather choose a futures instrument to trade.</p>\n<p>If I’m bullish with constraints attached (for example – I’m expecting the markets to bounce because of a great budget announcement, but I don’t want to risk much), it would be prudent to choose an option instrument.</p>\n<p>So the message here is – the market participant should develop a point of view and complement the POV with the right trading instrument. A well-researched POV combined with the right instrument to trade is a perfect recipe for market success.</p>\n<p>Also, by now, hopefully, you have got a sense of how all the different modules in “Varsity” play an important role in assimilating the market.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M1-ch13-chart.png\"><img alt=\"M1-ch13-chart\" class=\"size-full wp-image-355 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"490\" sizes=\"(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M1-ch13-chart.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M1-ch13-chart.png 547w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M1-ch13-chart-300x269.png 300w\" width=\"547\"/></a></p>\n<p>So keeping this in the background, go ahead and explore the content on <strong>Varsity at Zerodha. </strong></p>\n<p>The next two modules will explore concepts that will help us develop POV based on Technical and Fundamental Analysis.</p>\n<p>After reading through these two modules, you will get a sense of developing a point of view on markets. In the later modules, we will discuss the different trading instruments you can choose to complement your perspective. As we progress, we will ramp up the flow to help you start calibrating your trades with effective risk management techniques.</p>\n<p>Let’s roll!</p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

In the IPO, the company’s promoters choose to offer a certain percentage of shares to the public. The reason for going public and the process of an IPO is explained in detail in Chapters 4 and 5.</p>\n<p>The primary reason for going public is to raise capital to fund expansion projects or cash out early investors. After the IPO is listed on the exchange and is traded in the secondary market, promoters of the company might still want additional capital. There are three options available: Rights Issue, Offer for Sale and Follow-on Public Offer.</p>\n<h3>Rights Issue</h3>\n<p>The promoters can choose to raise additional capital from its existing shareholders by offering them new shares at a discounted price (generally lower than Market Price). The company offers new shares in the proportion of shares already held by the shareholders. For example, a 1:4 Rights Issue would mean that every 4 shares held 1 additional share is offered. Although this option looks good, it limits the company to raise the capital from a small number of investors who are already holding shares of the company and might not want to invest more. A rights issue leads to the creation of new shares that are offered to the shareholders, which dilutes the value of the previously held shares.</p>\n<p>An example of a Rights issue is South Indian Bank which announced a 1:3(One share for every 3 held) issue for Rs 14 which is 30% lower than the Market Price the stock was trading (Rs 20 as on Record date 17 Feb 2017). The bank offered 45.07 lakh shares to the existing shareholders.</p>\n<p>The rights issue is covered in detail in Chapter 11, covering key Corporate Actions.</p>\n<h3>OFS</h3>\n<p>The promoters can choose to offer the secondary issue of shares to the whole market, unlike a rights issue restricted to existing shareholders. The Exchange provides a separate window through the stockbrokers for the Offer for Sale. The exchange allows a company to route funds through OFS only if the Promoters want to sell out their holdings and/or maintain minimum public shareholding requirements (Govt. PSU have a public shareholding requirement of 25%).</p>\n<p>There is a floor price set by the company, at or above which both Retail and Non-Retail investors can make bids. The shares are allotted, if bids are at a cut-off price or above will be settled by the exchange into the investor Demat account in T+1 days.</p>\n<p>An example of an Offer for Sale is NTPC limited, which offered a maximum of 46.35 million shares at a floor price of Rs 168 and was fully subscribed in the 2 day period. The OFS was held on 29th August 2017 for Non-Retail Investors and 30th August 2017.</p>\n<h3>FPO</h3>\n<p>An FPO also has the same intent of raising additional capital after it has been listed but follows a different mechanism for applying and allotting shares. Shares can be diluted, and fresh shares can be created and offered in an FPO. Just like an IPO, an FPO requires that Merchant Bankers be appointed to create a Draft Red Herring Prospectus which has to be approved by SEBI after which bidding is allowed in a 3-5 day period. Investors can place their bids through ASBA and shares are allotted based on the Cut-off Price decided after the book-building process. Since the introduction of OFS in 2012, FPOs are seldom used due to the lengthy approval process.</p>\n<p>The company decides on a Price Band, and the FPO is publicly advertised. Prospective investors can bid for the issue using the ASBA portal through Internet Banking or apply offline through a Bank Branch. After the bidding process is complete, the cut-off price is declared based on the demand and the additional shares allotted are listed on the exchange for trading in the secondary markets.</p>\n<p>An example of an FPO is of Engineers India Ltd which underwent an issue in February 2014 with Rs 145-Rs 150. The issue was oversubscribed by 3 times. The shares on the day of the starting date of the issue were trading at Rs 151.1. The lower price band was at a 4.2% discount from the market price.</p>\n<h3>Difference between OFS and FPO</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>An OFS is used to offload Promoters’ shares while an FPO is used to fund new projects.</li>\n<li>Dilution of shares is allowed in an FPO leading to change in Shareholding structure while OFS does not affect the number of authorized shares.</li>\n<li>Only the companies with a Market Capitalisation of Rs 1000 crores and above can use the OFS route to raise funds while all the listed companies can use the FPO option.</li>\n<li>Ever since SEBI has introduced OFS, FPO issues have come down, and companies prefer to choose the OFS route to raise funds</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>The 20 Market Depth (level 3 data) Window</h2>\n<p>I’ve driven a car for many years and I’ve even changed my car a few times now. Each time I changed my car, the engine remained more or less the same, but the features within the vehicle and its aesthetics continuously changed. Air conditioner, power steering, and power windows were all luxury features in the car at one point, but today, I guess no one buys a car without these essential features. The game-changer for me though was parking assist. The little camera at the back of the car gave me complete visibility of the parking space available. I was no longer required to pop and twist my head out and struggle to park the car, nor did I have to bug my co-passenger to get down and help me navigate my way into a parking spot. The parking assist feature did everything and helped me execute a perfect parallel park. The parking assist feature was my edge for hassle-free car parking.</p>\n<p>I feel the same edge while trading the markets with the level 3 data 🙂</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/M1-C14-illustration.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6037 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/M1-C14-illustration.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/M1-C14-illustration.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/M1-C14-illustration-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>Level 3 or the 20 market depth feature is unique and has multiple uses. You’ll probably appreciate the level 3 market window if you have traded at an institutional desk. A regular retail trader would not understand this feature anytime soon, simply because this feature was unavailable all these years until we introduced it for the very first time to the Indian retail traders.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this chapter is to help you understand how useful this feature is and get you started on building trading strategies around this feature.</p>\n<p>If you are entirely new to this, I’d suggest you <strong><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/z-connect/featured/introducing-20-depth-or-level-3-data-beta-on-kite\">read this blog</a></strong> to understand what the level 3 data is all about.</p>\n<p>Assuming you know what it is, this chapter will help you understand the multiple uses of this feature.</p>\n<h2>Contract availability</h2>\n<p>For the option traders, the 20-depth order book gives great visibility into the availability of contracts to trade and help identify better price points to execute these trade. Without this visibility, it becomes really hard to trade illiquid contracts. While I’m specifically talking about options here, you can extend this to Futures contracts as well, especially the illiquid ones.</p>\n<p>Let us put this in context, have a look at the regular market depth (i.e. the top 5 bid-ask) of the 13000 CE expiring in Jan 2020.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-11_opt.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6071\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"335\" sizes=\"(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-11_opt-300x217.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-11_opt-300x217.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-11_opt.png 478w\" width=\"464\"/></a></p>\n<p>We can see narrow bids on the left and a notch better offer on the right. You’d probably hesitate to trade this contract if you are someone looking at trading a few lots of Nifty.</p>\n<p>But check what’s hiding under the hood here by opening the level 3 data –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-12_opt.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6072\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"721\" sizes=\"(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-12_opt.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-12_opt.png 464w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-12_opt-186x300.png 186w\" width=\"448\"/></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you can see, there are many contracts available, but they are not visible in the regular market depth. In fact, the bid and offer quantities are heavily concentrated below the 8<sup>th</sup> row respectively.</p>\n<p>Given the availability of the contracts in this strike, the perspective to trade or not completely changes and will now depend upon your trading strategy.</p>\n<h2><strong>Execution control</strong></h2>\n<p>Level 3 data gives you full visibility of the approximate execution price for your trade. This is particularly useful when you decide to scalp the market. When you scalp the market —</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You trade large quantities, i.e. buy and sell large amounts in quick succession to profit from small tick moves in the stock</li>\n<li>Since these are quick trades, you place market orders only</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let us say you want to buy and sell 5000 shares of Hindustan Zinc; the regular market depth window gives you the following information —</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-1_-reg.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6030 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"331\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-1_-reg.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-1_-reg.png 473w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-1_-reg-300x210.png 300w\" width=\"473\"/></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As you can see, there is no visibility on how these 5000 shares will get filled. Now, take a look at the 20 depth window —</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-2_20.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6031 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"743\" sizes=\"(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-2_20.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-2_20.png 462w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-2_20-187x300.png 187w\" width=\"462\"/></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The 20 depth window paints an entirely different picture. It not only tells me that I’ll get the 5000 shares, but it also gives me information about the approximate buy price. If I were to place a market order for 5000 shares, I’d be buying this order book from 210.5 to 211.25. I also see at 211; there are 2425 shares available, so I can expect the average price is at or around 211.</p>\n<p>Now, my decision to scalp the stock should depend on the pop I’d expect over and above 211. Maybe 211.5 or so. Of course, you’ll get the exact breakeven (post charges) if you were to use a brokerage calculator.</p>\n<h2><strong>Position sizing</strong></h2>\n<p>Level 3 market window plays a critical role in ‘guesstimating’ the number of shares to trade, given the liquidity of the stock. For the sake of this discussion, we will assume that the availability of capital is not an issue.</p>\n<p>Now, have a look at the regular market depth —</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-3_sie.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6032 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"336\" sizes=\"(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-3_sie.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-3_sie.png 463w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-3_sie-300x218.png 300w\" width=\"463\"/></a></p>\n<p>You expect Siemens to move from 1675 to about 1690 over the next hour. So, given the fact that you are not constrained by capital, how many shares will you buy for this intraday trade?</p>\n<p>The regular market depth window suggests that you can buy close to 175 shares. However, the 20 depth opens up a different perspective altogether —</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-4_sie20.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6033 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"747\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-4_sie20.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-4_sie20.png 465w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-4_sie20-187x300.png 187w\" width=\"465\"/></a></p>\n<p>In fact, the liquidity in this stock lies below the best five bid and ask, and the impact cost is reasonable. The regular market depth window fails to capture this information. Assuming you intend to buy about 1500 shares, the buy price will lie somewhere within 1675.5 to 1678, which is spread of 0.149%.</p>\n<p>In this case, assuming you are sure about the target price (1690), you can go all in and buy through whatever is available at that moment.</p>\n<h2><strong>Order placement</strong></h2>\n<p>You can extend the position sizing concept and use the 20 depth market watch to place a stop loss or a limit order. Assume you have an intraday buy position in VST Tillers at 1313.8.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-5_buy.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6034 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"56\" sizes=\"(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-5_buy.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-5_buy.png 472w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-5_buy-300x36.png 300w\" width=\"472\"/></a></p>\n<p>The question is, where you would place the stop loss for this trade? Can the 20 market depth help us with this?</p>\n<p>Of course. Have a look at the 20 depth window for VST Tillers. As you can see, there is a concentration of bids in 1290. The good part is that the number of order count is also the highest (35) in 1290.</p>\n<p>This implies that several traders have placed an order at 1290, indicating some sort of price action at that level. This perhaps builds a case for placing the stop-loss.</p>\n<p>A prudent trader would probably place a stoploss not at 1290, but maybe at a price just below it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-6_vst.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-6_vst.png\" width=\"338\"/></a></p>\n<p>So I was a buyer in this stock, then purely based on 20 depth I’d probably place my SL at 1290 or below, maybe at 1287 and by the same logic, set my target at 1340 or at 1338.8.</p>\n<h2><strong>Validate the support and resistance level</strong></h2>\n<p>I find this extremely interesting. In the example above, we identified 1290 as the stoploss price, simply because there was a concentration of bids. In other words, we expect 1290 as a support price.</p>\n<p>If this is indeed true, then it should show up on the charts as well, right? Have a look at the chart below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-7_vst-chart.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6036 size-large\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"668\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-7_vst-chart-1024x668.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-7_vst-chart-1024x668.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-7_vst-chart-300x196.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-7_vst-chart-768x501.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Image-7_vst-chart.png 1201w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>Clearly, there is some price action around 1296. Remember, support and resistance is not one price point, but rather a range. Therefore 1290 – 1300 marks as an intraday support for this stock.</p>\n<p>This is a perfect example of seeing the price action concept play out in the market.</p>\n<p>Another way to look at this is first to identify the S&amp;R level and then check the 20 depth to figure if there is a concentration of bids/offers in that zone.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hopefully, by now you’ve started to appreciate the immeasurable value 20 depth order book brings to you while trading.</p>\n<p>Remember, irrespective of which technique you use to develop a point of view (technical or quantitative analysis), things boil down to price, and the action trades take at that price.</p>\n<p>The 20 depth market window is essentially your ticket to validate the truth of this price action. Make sure you use your card wisely!</p>\n<p>Do post your comments and tell us how differently you will use the 20 depth window for identifying trading opportunities.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>1.1 – Overview</h2>\n<p>The previous module on the Basics of the stock market set us on a great starting point. Taking cues from the previous module, we know that developing a well-researched point of view is critical for success in the stock market. A good point of view should have a directional view and should also include information such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Price at which one should buy or sell stocks</li>\n<li>Expected Risk</li>\n<li>Expected reward</li>\n<li>Expected holding period</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Technical Analysis (also abbreviated as TA) is a popular technique that allows you to do just that. It helps you develop a point of view on a particular stock or index and helps you define the trade in terms of entry price, exit price, and risk.</p>\n<p>Like all stock market research techniques, Technical Analysis also comes with a few associated conditions and assumptions, some of which can be highly complex. However, technology makes it easy to understand and execute trades based on TA. We will discover these conditions as we proceed along with this module.</p>\n<h2>1.2 – Technical Analysis, what is it?</h2>\n<p>Consider this analogy.</p>\n<p>Imagine you are vacationing in a foreign country where everything, including the language, culture, weather, and food, is new to you. On day 1, you do the regular touristy activities, and by evening you are starving and craving food. You want to end your day by having a great dinner. You ask around for a good restaurant, and you are told about a vibrant food street close by. You decide to give it a try.</p>\n<p>To your surprise, the food street has 100s of vendors selling different varieties of food. Everything looks different and interesting. You are clueless as to what to eat for dinner. To add to your dilemma, you cannot ask around as you do not know the local language. So given all this, how will you decide on what to eat?</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch1-title\" class=\"size-full wp-image-499 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch1-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch1-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch1-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>Well, you have two options to figure out what to eat.</p>\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>You visit a vendor and figure out what they are cooking. Check on the ingredients used, figure out the cooking style, taste a bit, and determine if you like the food. You repeat this exercise across a few vendors, after which you would most likely eat at a place that satisfies you the most.</p>\n<p>The advantage of this technique is that you know exactly what you are eating since you have researched it independently. However, on the flip side, the methodology you adopted is not scalable. There could be about 100-odd vendors, and with limited time at your disposal, you can probably cover about 4 or 5 vendors.  Hence there is a high probability of missing out on the best-tasting food on the street!</p>\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>You stand in a corner and observe all the vendors. You try and find a vendor who is attracting the maximum crowd. Once you find such a vendor, you make a simple assumption -‘The vendor is attracting so many customers, which means they must be making the best food!’ Based on that assumption and the crowd’s preference, you decide to go to that particular vendor for dinner. The chances are that you could be eating the best-tasting food available on the street.</p>\n<p>The advantage of this method is its scalability. You need to spot the vendor with the maximum number of customers and bet that it is good based on the crowd’s preference. However, on the flip side, the crowd need not always be right.</p>\n<p>In the world of stock markets, option 1 is very similar to Fundamental Analysis, where you research a few companies thoroughly. We will explore the Fundamental Analysis in greater detail in the next module.</p>\n<p>Option 2 is similar to Technical Analysis, where one scans for opportunities based on the current trend, aka the market’s preference.</p>\n<p>Technical Analysis is a research technique to identify trading opportunities in the market based on market participants’ actions. The actions of market participants can be visualized in stock charts. Over time, patterns form in these charts, and each pattern conveys a certain message. The job of a technical analyst is to identify these patterns and develop a point of view.</p>\n<p>Like any research technique, technical analysis stands on a bunch of assumptions. As a technical analysis practitioner, you must trade the markets, keeping these assumptions in perspective. Of course, we will understand these assumptions in detail as we proceed along.</p>\n<p>Also, at this point, it makes sense to throw some light on a matter concerning FA and TA. Often, people argue that a particular research technique is a better approach to the market. However, there is no such thing as the best research approach. Every research method has its own merits and demerits. It would be futile to compare TA and FA to figure out a better approach.</p>\n<p>Both techniques are different and not comparable. A prudent trader would educate on both techniques to identify great trading or investing opportunities.</p>\n<h2>1.3 – Setting expectations</h2>\n<p>Market participants often approach technical analysis as a quick and easy way to profit. On the contrary, technical analysis is anything but quick and easy. If done right, consistently generating profits is possible, but to get to that stage, one must put in the required effort to learn the technique.</p>\n<p>A trading catastrophe is bound to happen if you approach TA as a quick and easy way to make money in markets. When a trading debacle happens, more often than not, the blame is on technical analysis and not on the trader’s inability to efficiently apply Technical Analysis. Hence before you start delving deeper into technical analysis, it is important to set expectations on what can and cannot be achieved with technical analysis.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><strong>Trades</strong> – TA is best used to identify short-term trades. Do not use TA to identify long-term investment opportunities. Long-term investment opportunities are best identified using fundamental analysis. Also, If you are a fundamental analyst, use TA to calibrate the entry and exit points.</li>\n<li><strong>Return per trade – </strong>TA-based trades are usually short-term in nature. Do not expect huge returns within a short duration of time. The right way to use TA is to identify frequent short-term trading opportunities that can give you small but consistent profits.</li>\n<li><strong>Holding Period – </strong>Trades based on technical analysis can last between a few minutes to a few weeks, usually not beyond that. We will explore this aspect when we discuss the topic of timeframes.</li>\n<li><strong>Risk ­</strong>– Often, traders initiate a trade for a certain reason; however, in case of an adverse movement in the stock, the trade starts to lose money. Usually, in such situations, traders hold on to their loss-making trade with the hope they can recover the loss. Remember, TA-based trades are short-term; if the trade goes bad, do remember to cut the losses and move on to identify the next opportunity.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Technical Analysis is a popular method to develop a point of view on markets. Besides, TA also helps in identifying entry and exit points.</li>\n<li>Technical Analysis visualizes the actions of market participants in the form of stock charts.</li>\n<li>Patterns are formed within the charts, and these patterns help a trader identify trading opportunities.</li>\n<li>TA works best when we keep a few core assumptions in perspective.</li>\n<li>TA is used best to identify short terms trades.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

In this chapter, we will dig a bit deeper and explore the assumptions technical analysis is based upon.</p>\n<h2>2.2 – Application on asset types</h2>\n<p>One of the greatest advantages of technical analysis is that you can apply TA on any asset class as long as the asset type has historical time series data. Time series data in technical analysis is the price information, namely – open high, low, close, volume, etc.</p>\n<p>Here is an analogy that may help. Think about learning how to drive a car. Once you learn how to drive a car, you can drive any car, whether a Mahindra XUV or a Maruti Swift. Likewise, you only need to learn technical analysis once. Once you do so, you can apply TA on any asset class – equities, commodities, foreign exchange, fixed income, etc.</p>\n<p>The fact that TA can be applied to multiple assets is probably one of the biggest advantages of TA compared to the other stock market research techniques. For example, one has to study the profit and loss, balance sheet, and cash flow statements when it comes to the fundamental analysis of equity. However, the fundamental analysis of commodities is completely different.</p>\n<p>When dealing with an agricultural commodity like Coffee or Pepper, the fundamental analysis includes analyzing rainfall, harvest, demand, supply, inventory etc. However, the fundamentals of metal commodities are different, so it is for energy commodities. So every time you choose a commodity, the fundamentals change.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the concept of technical analysis will remain the same irrespective of the asset you are studying. For example, an indicator such as ‘Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) or ‘Relative strength index (RSI) is used the same way on equity, commodity, or currency.</p>\n<h2>2.3 – Assumption in Technical Analysis</h2>\n<p>Unlike fundamental analysts, technical analysts don’t worry about the company’s valuation. The only thing that matters is the stock’s historical trading data (price and volume) and the insights the past data provides about the future movement in stock price.</p>\n<p>Technical Analysis is based on a few key assumptions. You need to know these assumptions to ensure you use technical analysis effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong><em>Markets discount everything</em></strong> – This assumption tells us that all known and unknown information in the public domain is reflected in the latest stock price. For example, an insider could buy the company’s stock in large quantities in anticipation of a good quarterly earnings announcement. While the insider does this secretively, the price reacts, revealing to the technical analyst that something is about to happen in the stock price.</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> <strong><em>The ‘how’ is more important than the ‘why’</em> – </strong>This is an extension of the first assumption. Going with the same example discussed above – the technical analyst would not be interested in questioning <strong>why</strong> the insider bought the stock as long as the technical analyst knows <strong>how</strong> the price reacted to the insider’s action.</p>\n<p><strong>3) </strong><strong><em>Price moves in trend –</em></strong>  All major moves in the market are an outcome of a trend. The concept of trend is the foundation of technical analysis. For example, the recent upward movement in the NIFTY 50 Index to 18500 from 14750 did not happen overnight. This move happened in a phased manner in over 11 months. Another way to look at it is that once the trend is established, the price moves in the direction of the trend.</p>\n<p><strong>4)</strong> <strong><em>History tends to repeat itself – </em></strong>In the technical analysis context, the price trend tends to repeat itself. This happens because the market participants consistently react to price movements in remarkably similar ways every time the price moves in a certain direction. For example, in an uptrend, market participants get greedy and want to buy irrespective of the high price. Likewise, market participants want to sell in a downtrend irrespective of the low and unattractive prices. This human reaction has been the same towards stock prices over time, ensuring that history repeats itself.</p>\n<h2>2.4 – The Trade Summary</h2>\n<p>The Indian stock market is open from 9:15 AM to 03:30 PM. During the 6 hours 15-minute market session, millions of trades occur. Think about an individual stock – every minute, a trade gets executed on the exchange. As market participants do we need to keep track of all the different price points at which a trade is executed?</p>\n<p>To illustrate this further, let us consider this imaginary stock in which many trades exist. Look at the picture below. Each point refers to a trade being executed at a particular time. If one manages to plot a graph that includes every second from 9:15 AM to 3:30 PM, the graph will be cluttered with many points. I’ve tried to represent this in the chart below –</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch1-Chart1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-455 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"255\" sizes=\"(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch1-Chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch1-Chart1.jpg 628w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch1-Chart1-300x122.jpg 300w\" width=\"628\"/></p>\n<p>The market opened at 9:15 AM and closed at 3:30 PM, during which there were many trades. It will be practically impossible to track all these different price points. One needs a summary of the trading action and not the details on all the different price points.</p>\n<p>We can summarise the price action by tracking the Open, high, low, and close.</p>\n<p><strong>Open Price</strong> – When the markets open for trading, the first price a trade executes is called the opening price.</p>\n<p><strong>The High Price – </strong>This represents the highest price at which a trade occurred for the given day.</p>\n<p><strong>The Low Price – </strong>This represents the lowest price at which a trade occurred for the given day.</p>\n<p><strong>The Close Price – </strong>This is the most important price because it is the final price at which the market closes for the day. The close indicates the intraday strength and a reference price for the next day. If the close is higher than the open, it is considered a positive day; otherwise negative. Of course, we will deal with this in greater detail as we progress through the module.</p>\n<p>The closing price also shows the market sentiment and serves as a reference point for the next day’s trading. For these reasons, closing is more important than the opening, high or low prices.</p>\n<p>The main data points from the technical analysis perspective are open, high, low, and close prices. Each of these prices has to be plotted on the chart and analyzed.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch1-Chart2\" class=\"size-full wp-image-457 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"349\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch1-Chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch1-Chart2.jpg 622w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch1-Chart2-300x168.jpg 300w\" width=\"622\"/></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Key takeaways from this chapter</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Its scope does not bind to technical Analysis. The TA concepts can be applied across asset classes as long as it has time-series data.</li>\n<li> TA is based on a few core assumptions.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Markets discount everything</li>\n<li>The how is more important than the why</li>\n<li>Price moves in trends</li>\n<li>History tends to repeat itself.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>A good way to summarize the daily trading action is by marking the open, high, low, and close prices, usually abbreviated as OHLC</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

If not for a good charting technique, charts can get quite complex. Each trading day has four data points, ’ i.e. the OHLC. If we are looking at a 10-day chart, we need to visualize 40 data points (1-day x 4 data points per day). So you can imagine how complex it would be to visualize 6 months or a year’s data.</p>\n<p>As you may have guessed, the regular charts that we are generally used to – like the column chart, pie chart, area chart etc. do not work for technical analysis. The only exception to this is the line chart.</p>\n<p>The regular charts don’t work mainly because they display one data point at a given point in time. However, Technical Analysis requires four data points to be displayed at the same time.</p>\n<p>Below are some of the chart types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Line chart</li>\n<li>Bar Chart</li>\n<li>Japanese Candlestick</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This module’s focus will be on the Japanese Candlesticks; however, before we get to candlesticks, we will understand why we don’t use the line and bar chart.</p>\n<h2>3.2 – The Line and Bar chart</h2>\n<p>The line chart is the most basic chart type, and it uses only one data point to form the chart. When it comes to technical analysis, a line chart is formed by plotting a stock’s closing prices or an index. A dot is placed for each closing price, and a line then connects the various dots.</p>\n<p>If we are looking at 60-day data, then the line chart is formed by connecting the closing prices’ dots for 60 days.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch3-Chart1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-472 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"255\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch3-Chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch3-Chart1.jpg 624w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch3-Chart1-300x123.jpg 300w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>The line charts can be plotted for various time frames, namely monthly, weekly, hourly etc. So, if you wish to draw a weekly line chart, you can use weekly closing prices of securities and other time frames.</p>\n<p>The advantage of the line chart is its simplicity. With one glance, the trader can identify the general trend of security. However, the disadvantage of the line chart is also its simplicity. Besides giving the analysts a view on the trend, the line chart does not provide any additional detail. Plus the line chart takes into consideration only the closing prices ignoring the open, high and low. For this reason, traders prefer not to use the line charts.</p>\n<p><strong>The bar chart, on the other hand,</strong> is a bit more versatile. A bar chart displays all four price variables: open, high, low, and close. A bar has three components.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The central line – The top of the bar indicates the highest price the security has reached. The bottom end of the bar indicates the lowest price for the same period.</li>\n<li>The left mark/tick – indicates the open.</li>\n<li>The right mark/tick – indicates the close.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, assume the OHLC data for a stock as follows:</p>\n<p>Open – 65<br/>\nHigh – 70<br/>\nLow – 60<br/>\nClose – 68</p>\n<p>For the above data, the bar chart would look like this:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-ch3-diagrams-1\" class=\"size-full wp-image-473 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"199\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-1.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-1-300x149.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see, in a single bar, we can plot four different price points. If you wish to view 5 days chart, we will have 5 vertical bars as you would imagine. So on and so forth.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch3-Chart2\" class=\"size-full wp-image-475 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"233\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch3-Chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch3-Chart2.jpg 1315w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch3-Chart2-300x112.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch3-Chart2-1024x382.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>Note that the left and right mark on the bar chart varies based on how the market has moved for the given day.</p>\n<p>If the left mark, which represents the opening price, is lower than the right mark, it indicates that the close is higher than the open (close &gt; open), hence a positive day for the markets. For example consider this: O = 46, H = 51, L = 45, C = 49. To indicate it is a bullish day, the bar is represented in blue colour.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-ch3-diagrams-2\" class=\"size-full wp-image-478 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"199\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-2.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-2-300x149.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>Likewise, if the left mark is higher than the right mark, it indicates that the close is lower than the open (close &lt;open), hence a negative day for markets. For example consider this: O = 74, H=76, L=70, C=71. To indicate it is a bearish day, the bar is represented in red colour.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-ch3-diagrams-3\" class=\"size-full wp-image-479 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"199\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-3.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-3-300x149.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>The length of the central line indicates the range for the day. A range can be defined as the difference between the high and low. Longer the line, bigger the range, shorter the line, smaller is the range.</p>\n<p>While the bar chart displays all the four data points, it still lacks a visual appeal. This is probably the biggest disadvantage of a bar chart. It becomes tough to spot potential patterns brewing when one is looking at a bar chart. The complexity increases when a trader has to analyze multiple charts during the day.</p>\n<p>Hence, for this reason, the traders do not use bar charts. However, it is worth mentioning that there are traders who prefer to use bar charts. But if you are starting fresh, I would strongly recommend the use of Japanese Candlesticks. Candlesticks are the default option for the majority in the trading community.</p>\n<h2>3.3 – History of the Japanese Candlestick</h2>\n<p>Before we jump in, it is worth spending time to understand in brief the history of the Japanese Candlesticks. As the name suggests, the candlesticks originated from Japan. The earliest use of candlesticks dates back to the 18<sup>th</sup> century by a Japanese rice merchant named Homma Munehisa.</p>\n<p>Though the candlesticks have been in existence for a long time in Japan, and are probably the oldest form of price analysis, the western world traders were clueless about it. It is believed that sometime around 1980’s a trader named Steve Nison accidentally discovered candlesticks, and he introduced the methodology to the rest of the world. He authored the first-ever book on candlesticks titled “Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques” which is still a favourite amongst many traders.</p>\n<p>Most of the candlesticks pattern still retains the Japanese names; thus giving an oriental feel to technical analysis.</p>\n<h2>3.4 – Candlestick Anatomy</h2>\n<p>While in a bar chart the open and the close prices are shown by a tick on the left and the right sides of the bar respectively, however in a candlestick the open and close prices are displayed by a rectangular body.</p>\n<p>In a candlestick chart, candles can be classified as a bullish or bearish candle usually represented by blue/green/white and red/black candles. Needless to say, the colours can be customized to any colour of your choice; the technical analysis software allows you to do this. This module has opted for the blue and red combination to represent bullish and bearish candles, respectively.</p>\n<p>Let us look at the <strong>bullish candle</strong>. The candlestick, like a bar chart, is made of 3 components.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Central real body – The real body, rectangular connects the opening and closing price.</li>\n<li>Upper shadow – Connects the high point to the close.</li>\n<li>Lower Shadow – Connects the low point to the open.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Have a look at the image below to understand how a bullish candlestick is formed:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-ch3-diagrams-4\" class=\"size-full wp-image-509 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"199\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-41.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-41.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-41-300x149.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>This is best understood with an example. Let us assume the prices as follows.</p>\n<p>Open = 62<br/>\nHigh = 70<br/>\nLow = 58<br/>\nClose = 67</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-ch3-diagrams-5\" class=\"size-full wp-image-482 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"199\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-5.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-5-300x149.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>Likewise, the bearish candle also has 3 components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Central real body – The real body, rectangular which connects the opening and closing price. However, the opening is at the top end, and the closing is at the rectangle’s bottom end.</li>\n<li>Upper shadow – Connects the high point to the open.</li>\n<li>Lower Shadow – Connects the Low point to the close.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is how a bearish candle would look like:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-ch3-diagrams-6\" class=\"size-full wp-image-510 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"199\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-61.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-61.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-61-300x149.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>This is best understood with an example. Let us assume the prices as follows.</p>\n<p>Open = 456<br/>\nHigh = 470<br/>\nLow = 420<br/>\nClose = 435</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-ch3-diagrams-7\" class=\"size-full wp-image-484 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"199\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-7.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch3-diagrams-7-300x149.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>Here is a little exercise to help you understand the candlestick pattern better. Try and plot the candlesticks for the given data.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Day</th>\n<th>Open</th>\n<th>High</th>\n<th>Low</th>\n<th>Close</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Day 1</td>\n<td>430</td>\n<td>444</td>\n<td>425</td>\n<td>438</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Day 2</td>\n<td>445</td>\n<td>455</td>\n<td>438</td>\n<td>450</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Day 3</td>\n<td>445</td>\n<td>455</td>\n<td>430</td>\n<td>437</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If you find any difficulty in doing this exercise, please ask your query in the comments at the end of this chapter.</p>\n<p>Once you internalize the way candlesticks are plotted, reading the candlesticks to identify patterns becomes a lot easier.</p>\n<p>This is how the candlestick chart looks like if you were to plot them on a time series. The blue candle indicates bullishness and red indicates bearishness.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch3-Chart3\" class=\"size-full wp-image-486 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"222\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch3-Chart3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch3-Chart3.jpg 1319w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch3-Chart3-300x107.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch3-Chart3-1024x365.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>Also note, a long-bodied candle depicts strong buying or selling activity. A short-bodied candle depicts less trading activity and hence less price movement.</p>\n<p>To sum up, candlesticks are easier to interpret in comparison to the bar chart. Candlesticks help you quickly visualize the relationship between the open and close and the high and low price points.</p>\n<h2>3.5 – A note on time frames</h2>\n<p>A time frame is defined as the time duration during which one chooses to study a particular chart. Some of the popular time frames that technical analysts use are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Monthly Charts</li>\n<li>Weekly charts</li>\n<li>Daily or End of day charts</li>\n<li>Intraday charts – 30 Mins, 15 mins and 5 minutes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One can customize the time frame as per their requirement. For example, a high-frequency trader may want to use a 1-minute chart instead of any other time frame.</p>\n<p>Here is a quick note on different types of time frames.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Time Frame</th>\n<th>Open</th>\n<th>High</th>\n<th>Low</th>\n<th>Close</th>\n<th>No of Candles</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monthly</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The opening price on the first day of the month</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The highest price at which the stock traded during the entire month</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The lowest price at which the stock traded during the entire month</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The closing price on the last day of the month</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">12 candles for the entire year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Weekly</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Monday’s Opening Price</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The highest price at which the stock traded during the entire week</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The lowest price at which the stock traded during the entire week</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The closing price on Friday</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">52 candles for the entire year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Daily or EOD</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The opening price of the day</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The highest price at which the stock traded during the day</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The lowest price at which the stock traded during the entire day</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The closing price of the day</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">One candle per day, 252 candles for the entire year</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intraday 30 minutes</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The opening price at the beginning of the 1st minute</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The highest price at which the stock traded during the 30-minute duration</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The lowest price at which the stock traded during the 30-minute duration</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The closing price as on the 30th minute</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Approximately 12 candles per day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intraday 15 minutes</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The opening price at the beginning of the 1st minute</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The highest price at which the stock traded during the 15-minute duration</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The lowest price at which the stock traded during the 15-minute duration</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The closing price as on the 15th minute</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">25 candles per day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Intraday 5 minutes</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The opening price at the beginning of the 1st minute</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The highest price at which the stock traded during the 5-minute duration</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The lowest price at which the stock traded during the 5-minute duration</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">The closing price as on the 5th minute</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">75 candles per day</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As you can see from the table above, the number of candles (data points) increases when the time frame reduces. Based on the type of trader you are, you need to take a stand on the time frame you need.</p>\n<p>The data can either be information or noise. As a trader, you need to filter information from noise. For instance, a long term investor is better off looking at weekly or monthly charts as this would provide information. While on the other hand an intraday trader executing 1 or 2 trades per day is better off looking at the end of the day (EOD) or at best 15 mins charts. Likewise, for a high-frequency trader, 1-minute charts can convey a lot of information.</p>\n<p>So based on your stance as a trader, you need to choose a time frame. This is extremely crucial for your trading success because a successful trader looks for information and discards the noise.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li> Conventional chart type cannot be used for technical analysis as we need to plot 4 data points simultaneously.</li>\n<li> A line chart can be used to interpret trends, but no other information can be derived.</li>\n<li> Bar charts lack visual appeal, and one cannot identify patterns easily. For this reason, bar charts are not very popular.</li>\n<li> There are two types of candlesticks – Bullish candle and Bearish candle. The structure of the candlestick, however, remains the same.</li>\n<li> When close &gt; open = It is a Bullish candle. When close &lt; open = It is a Bearish candle.</li>\n<li> Time frames play a very crucial role in defining trading success. One has to choose this carefully.</li>\n<li> The number of candle increases as and when the frequency increases</li>\n<li> Traders should be in a position to discard noise from relevant information</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

This probably is one of the most important assumptions in Technical Analysis.</p>\n<p>It would make sense to explore this assumption in greater detail at this juncture as candlestick patterns are heavily dependent on it.</p>\n<p>Assume today, the 7<sup>th</sup> of July 2014 few things are happening in a particular stock. Let us call this factor:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Factor 1</strong> – The stock has been falling for the last 4 consecutive trading sessions</li>\n<li><strong>Factor 2</strong> –Today (7<sup>th</sup> July 2014) is the 5<sup>th</sup> session, and the stock is falling on relatively lower volumes</li>\n<li><strong>Factor 3</strong> – The range in which the stock trades today is quite small compared to the last four days.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With these factors playing in the background, let us assume that on the next day (8<sup>th</sup> July 2014) the fall in stock gets arrested and the stock rallies towards a positive close. So, as an outcome of the 3 factors, the stock went up on the 6<sup>th</sup> day.</p>\n<p>Time passes and let’s says after a few months, the same set of factors is observed for 5 consecutive trading sessions. What would you expect for the 6<sup>th</sup> day?</p>\n<p>According to the assumption – History tends to repeat itself. However, we need to make an addendum to this assumption. When a set of factors that have panned out in the past tends to repeat itself in the future, we expect the same outcome to occur, as was observed in the past, provided the factors are the same.</p>\n<p>Therefore, based on this assumption, we can expect the stock price to go up on the 6<sup>th</sup> trading session even this time around.</p>\n<h2>4.2 – Candlestick patterns and what to expect</h2>\n<p>The candlesticks are used to identify trading patterns. Patterns, in turn, help the technical analyst to set up a trade. The patterns are formed by grouping two or more candles in a certain sequence. However, sometimes powerful trading signals can be identified by just a single candlestick pattern.</p>\n<p>Hence, candlesticks can be broken down into single candlestick pattern and multiple candlestick patterns.</p>\n<p>Under the single candlestick pattern, we will be learning the following…</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Marubozu\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Bullish Marubozu</li>\n<li>Bearish Marubozu</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Doji</li>\n<li>Spinning Tops</li>\n<li>Paper umbrella\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Hammer</li>\n<li>Hanging man</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Shooting star</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Multiple candlestick patterns are a combination of multiple candles. Under the multiple candlestick patterns, we will learn the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Engulfing pattern\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Bullish Engulfing</li>\n<li>Bearish Engulfing</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Harami\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Bullish Harami</li>\n<li>Bearish Harami</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Piercing Pattern</li>\n<li>Dark cloud cover</li>\n<li>Morning Star</li>\n<li>Evening Star</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, you must be wondering what these names mean. As I had mentioned in the previous chapter, some of the patterns retain the original Japanese name.</p>\n<p>Candlestick patterns help the trader develop a complete point of view. Each pattern comes with an in-built risk mechanism. Candlesticks give an insight into both entry and stop-loss price.</p>\n<h2>4.3 – Few assumptions specific to candlesticks</h2>\n<p>Before we jump in and start learning about the patterns, there are few more assumptions that we need to keep in mind. These assumptions are specific to candlesticks. Do pay a lot of attention to these assumptions as we will keep referring back to these assumptions quite often later.</p>\n<p>At this stage, these assumptions may not be obvious to you. I will explain them in greater detail as and when we proceed. However, do keep these assumptions in the back of your mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy strength and sell weakness</strong> – Strength is represented by a bullish (blue) candle and weakness by a bearish (red) candle. Hence whenever you are buying ensure, it is a blue candle day and whenever you are selling, ensure it’s a red candle day.</li>\n<li><strong>Be flexible with patterns (quantify and verify)</strong> – While the textbook definition of a pattern could state certain criteria, there could be minor variations to the pattern owing to market conditions. So one needs to be a bit flexible. However, one needs to be flexible within limits, and hence it is always required to quantify the flexibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Look for a prior trend</strong> – If you are looking at a bullish pattern, the prior trend should be bearish, and likewise, if you are looking for a bearish pattern, the prior trend should be bullish.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the next chapter, we will begin by learning about single candlestick patterns.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>History tends to repeat itself – we modified this assumption by adding the factor angle.</li>\n<li>Candlestick patterns can be broken down into single and multiple candlestick patterns.</li>\n<li>There are three important assumptions specific to candlestick patterns.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Buy strength and sell weakness.</li>\n<li>Be flexible – quantify and verify.</li>\n<li>Look for a prior trend.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

So as you can imagine, the trading signal is generated based on 1 day’s trading action. The trades based on a single candlestick pattern can be extremely profitable provided the pattern has been identified and executed correctly.</p>\n<p>One needs to pay some attention to the length of the candle while trading based on candlestick patterns. The length signifies the range for the day. In general, the longer the candle, the more intense is the buying or selling activity. If the candles are short, it can be concluded that the trading action was subdued.</p>\n<p>The following picture gives a perspective on the long/short – bullish, and bearish candle.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-ch5-D1a\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-581\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch5-D1a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch5-D1a.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch5-D1a-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>The trades have to be qualified based on the length of the candle as well. One should avoid trading based on subdued short candles. We will understand this perspective as and when we learn about specific patterns.</p>\n<h2>5.2 – The Marubozu</h2>\n<p>The Marubozu is the first single candlestick pattern that we will understand. The word Marubozu means “Bald” in Japanese. We will understand the context of the terminology soon. There are two types of marubozu – the bullish marubozu and the bearish marubozu.</p>\n<p>Before we proceed, let us lay down the three important rules about candlesticks. We looked at it in the previous chapter; I’ve reproduced the same for quick reference:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy strength and sell weakness.</li>\n<li>Be flexible with patterns (verify and quantify)</li>\n<li>Look for the prior trend.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Marubozu is probably the only candlestick pattern that violates rule number 3, i.e., looking for a prior trend. A Marubozu can appear anywhere in the chart irrespective of the prior trend; the trading implication remains the same.</p>\n<p>The textbook defines Marubozu as a candlestick with no upper and lower shadow (therefore appearing bald). A Marubozu has just the real body, as shown below. However, there are exceptions to this. We will look into these exceptions shortly.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-ch5-D2a\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-583\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch5-D2a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch5-D2a.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-ch5-D2a-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>The red candle represents the bearish marubozu, and the blue represents the bullish marubozu.</p>\n<h2><img alt=\"bullish-marubuzo\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-585\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bullish-marubuzo.png\" width=\"131\"/>5.3 – Bullish Marubozu</h2>\n<p>The absence of the upper and lower shadow in a bullish marubozu implies that the low is equal to the open and the high is equal to the close. Hence whenever the <strong>Open = Low and High = close</strong>, a bullish marubozu is formed.</p>\n<p>A bullish marubozu indicates that there is so much buying interest in the stock that the market participants were willing to buy the stock at every price point during the day, so much so that the stock closed near its high point for the day. It does not matter what the prior trend has been, the action on the marubozu day suggests that the sentiment has changed and the stock is now bullish.</p>\n<p>The expectation is that with this sudden change in sentiment, there is a surge of bullishness, and this bullish sentiment will continue over the next few trading sessions. Hence a trader should look at buying opportunities with the occurrence of a bullish marubozu. The <strong>buying price</strong> should be around the closing price of the marubozu.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch5-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-533 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"280\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart1.jpg 1335w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart1-300x135.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart1-1024x460.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>In the chart above (ACC Limited), the encircled candle is a bullish marubozu. Notice the bullish marubozu candle does not have a visible upper and a lower shadow. The OHLC data for the candle is: Open = 971.8, High = 1030.2, Low = 970.1, Close = 1028.4</p>\n<p>Please notice the textbook definition of a marubozu <strong>Open = Low, and High = Close</strong>. However, in reality, there is a minor variation to this definition. The price variation is not much when measured in percentage terms, for example, the variation between high and close is 1.8, which as a percentage of high is just 0.17%. <strong>This is where the 2<sup>nd</sup> rule applies – Be flexible, Quantify and Verify</strong>.</p>\n<p>With this occurrence of a marubozu the expectation has turned bullish, and hence one would be a buyer of the stock. The trade setup for this would be as follows:</p>\n<p>Buy Price = Around 1028.4 and Stoploss = 970.0</p>\n<p>As it is evident, candlestick patterns do not give us a target. However, we will address the issue of setting targets at a later stage in this module.</p>\n<p>Having decided to buy the stock, when do we actually buy the stock? The answer to this depends on your risk appetite. Let us assume two types of a trader with different risk profiles – the risk-taker and the risk-averse.</p>\n<p><strong>The risk-taker</strong> would buy the stock on the same day as the marubozu is being formed. However, the trader needs to validate the occurrence of a marubozu. Validating is quite simple. Indian markets close at 3:30 PM. So, around 3:20 PM one needs to check if the <strong>current market price (CMP) is approximately equal to the high price for the day, and the opening price of the day is approximately equal to the low price the day</strong>. If this condition is satisfied, you know the day is forming a marubozu, you can buy the stock around the closing price. It is also essential to note that the risk-taker is buying on a bullish/blue candle day, thereby following rule 1, i.e., buying on strength and selling on weakness.</p>\n<p><strong>The risk-averse</strong> trader would buy the stock on the next day, i.e. the day after the pattern has been formed. However, before buying the trader, ensure that the day is a bullish day to comply with rule number 1. This means the risk-averse buyer can buy the stock only around the close of the day. The disadvantage of buying the next day is that the buy price is way above the suggested buy price, and therefore the stoploss is quite deep. However, as a trade-off, the risk-averse trader is buying only after doubly confirming that the bullishness is indeed established.</p>\n<p>As per the ACC’s chart above, both the risk taker and the risk-averse would have been profitable in their trades.</p>\n<p>Here is another example (Asian Paints Ltd) where both the risk-taker, and the risk-averse trader would have been profitable.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch5-Chart2\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-534 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"211\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart2.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></p>\n<p>Here is an example where the risk-averse trader would have benefited :</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch5-Chart3\" class=\"size-full wp-image-535 aligncenter\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"181\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart3.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>Notice in the chart above, a bullish marubozu has been encircled. The risk-taker would have initiated a trade to buy the stock on the same day around the close, only to book a loss on the next day. However, the risk-averse would have avoided buying the stock entirely because the next day happened to be a red candle day. Going by the rule, we should buy only on a blue candle day and sell on a red candle day.</p>\n<h2>5.4 – The Stoploss on Bullish Marubozu</h2>\n<p>What if after buying, the market reverses its direction and the trade goes wrong? Like I had mentioned earlier, candlestick patterns come with an inbuilt risk management mechanism. In case of a bullish marubozu, the low of the stock acts as a stoploss. So after you initiate a buy trade, if the markets move in the opposite direction, you should exit the stock if price breaches the low of the marubozu.</p>\n<p>Here is an example where the bullish marubozu qualified as a buy for both the risk-averse and the risk-taker. The OHLC is : O = 960.2, H = 988.6, L = 959.85, C = 988.5.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch5-Chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-536\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"277\" sizes=\"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart4.jpg 621w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart4-300x134.jpg 300w\" width=\"621\"/></p>\n<p>But the pattern eventually failed, and one would have booked a loss. The stoploss for this trade would be the low of marubozu, i.e. 959.85.</p>\n<p>Booking a loss is a part of the game. Even a seasoned trader goes through this. However, the best part of following the candlestick is that the losses cannot run indefinitely. There is a clear agenda as to what price one has to get out of trade provided the trade starts to move in the opposite direction. In this particular case booking a loss would have been the most prudent thing to do as the stock continued to go down.</p>\n<p>Of course, there could be instances where the stoploss gets triggered, and you pull out of the trade. But the stock could reverse direction and start going up after you pulled out of the trade. But unfortunately, this is also a part of the game, and one cannot really help it. No matter what happens, the trader should stick to the rules and not find excuses to deviate from it.</p>\n<h2><img alt=\"bearish-marubuzo\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-587\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bearish-marubuzo.png\" width=\"131\"/>5.5 – Bearish Marubozu</h2>\n<p>Bearish Marubozu indicates extreme bearishness. Here the open is equal to the high and close the is equal to low. Open = High, and Close = Low.</p>\n<p>A bearish marubozu indicates that there is so much selling pressure in the stock that the market participants actually sold at every price point during the day, so much so that the stock closed near its low point of the day. It does not matter what the prior trend has been, the action on the marubozu day suggests that the sentiment has changed and the stock is now bearish.</p>\n<p>The expectation is that this sudden change in sentiment will be carried forward over the next few trading sessions, and hence one should look at shorting opportunities. The selling price should be around the closing price of the marubozu.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch5-Chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-537\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"261\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart5.jpg 624w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart5-300x125.jpg 300w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>In the chart above (BPCL Limited), the encircled candle indicates the presence of a bearish marubozu. Notice the candle does not have an upper and a lower shadow. The OHLC data for the candle is as follows:</p>\n<p>Open = 355.4, High = 356.0, Low = 341, Close = 341.7</p>\n<p>As we had discussed earlier, a minor variation between the OHLC figures leading to small upper and lower shadows is ok as long as it is within a reasonable limit.</p>\n<p>The trade on the bearish marubozu would be to short BPCL approximately at 341.7 with a stoploss at the high point of the candle. In this case, the stoploss price is 356.0. Of course, we still haven’t dealt with setting targets at this stage, and we will figure that out much later in this module.</p>\n<p>Remember this: Once a trade is initiated, you should hold on to it until either the target is hit or the stoploss is breached. If you attempt to do something else before any one of these event triggers, your trade could most likely go bust. So staying on the course of the plan is extremely crucial.</p>\n<p>Trade can be initiated based on the risk appetite of the person. The risk-taker can initiate a short trade on the same day around the closing. Of course, he has to make sure that the candle is forming a bearish marubozu. To do this at 3:20 PM, the trader must confirm if the open is approximately equal to the high and the current market price is equal to the low price. If the condition is validated, then it is a bearish marubozu, a short position can be initiated.</p>\n<p>If the trader is risk-averse, he can wait till the next day’s closing. The short trade will go through only by 3:20 PM next day after ensuring that the day is a red candle day. This is also to ensure that we comply with 1<sup>st</sup> rule – Buy strength, and Sell weakness.</p>\n<p>In the BPCL chart above, both risk taker and risk-averse would have been profitable.</p>\n<p>Here is another chart, Cipla Limited, where the bearish marubozu has been profitable for both risk-taker, and a risk-averse trader. Remember these are short term trades and one needs to be quick in booking profits.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch5-Chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-538\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"230\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart6.jpg 1315w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart6-300x110.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart6-1024x377.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>Here is a chart showing a bearish marubozu pattern that would not have worked out for the risk-taker, but a risk-averse trader would have avoided initiating the trade, thanks to rule 1.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch5-Chart7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-539\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"227\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart7.jpg 624w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch5-Chart7-300x109.jpg 300w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<h2>5.6 – The trade trap</h2>\n<p>Earlier in this chapter, we did discuss the length of the candle. One should avoid trading during a minimal (below 1% range) or long candle (above 10% range).</p>\n<p>A small candle indicates subdued trading activity, and hence it would be difficult to identify the direction of the trade. On the other hand, a long candle indicates extreme activity. The problem with lengthy candles would be the placement of stoploss. The stoploss would be deep, and in case the trade goes wrong, the penalty for paying would be painful. For this reason, one should avoid trading on candles that are either too short or too long.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Remember the rules based on which candlesticks work.</li>\n<li>Marubozu is the only pattern which violates rule number 3, i.e. Look for the prior trend.</li>\n<li>A bullish marubozu indicates bullishness.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Buy around the closing price of a bullish marubozu</li>\n<li>Keep the low of the marubozu as the stoploss</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>A bearish marubozu indicates bearishness.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Sell around the closing price of a bearish marubozu</li>\n<li>Keep the high of the marubozu as the stoploss</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>An aggressive trader can place the trade on the same day as the pattern forms.</li>\n<li>Risk-averse traders can place the trade on the next day after ensuring that it obeys rule number 1, i.e. Buy strength, and Sell weakness.</li>\n<li>Abnormal candle lengths should not be traded.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Short candle indicates subdued activity.</li>\n<li>Long candle indicates extreme activity; however, placing stoploss becomes an issue.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

Unlike the Marubuzo, it does not give the trader a trading signal with specific entry or an exit point. However, the spinning top gives out useful information concerning the current situation in the market. The trader can use this information to position himself in the market.</p>\n<p>A spinning top looks like the candle shown below. Take a good look at the candle. What observations do you make concerning the structure of the candle?</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch6-D1a\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-592\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-D1a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-D1a.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-D1a-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>Two things are quite prominent…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The candles have a small real body.</li>\n<li> The upper and lower shadow is almost equal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What do you think would have transpired during the day that leads to creating a spinning top? On its face, the spinning top looks like a humble candle with a small real body, but in reality, there were a few dramatic events that took place during the day.</p>\n<p>Let us follow these events:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Small real body</strong> – This indicates that the open price and close price are quite close. For instance, the open could be 210, and the close could be 213. Or the open could be 210 and close at 207. Both these situations lead to creating a small real body because a 3 point move on a 200 Rupee stock is not much. Because the open and close price points are nearby to one another, the colour of the candle does not really matter. It could be a blue or a red candle, what really matters is that the open prices and close prices are near to one another.</li>\n<li><strong>The upper shadow </strong>– The upper shadow connects the real body to the high point of the day. If it is a red candle, the high and open are connected. If it is a blue candle, the high and close are connected. If you think about the real body in conjunction with the upper shadow ignoring the lower shadow, what do you think had happened? The presence of the upper shadow tells us that the bulls did attempt to take the market higher. However, they were not really successful in their endeavour. If the bulls were truly successful, then the real body would have been a long blue candle and not really a short candle. Hence this can be treated as an attempt by the bulls to take the markets higher, but they were not really successful at it.</li>\n<li><strong>The lower shadow – </strong>The lower shadow connects the real body to the low point of the day. If it is a red candle, the low and close are connected. If it is a blue candle, the low and open are connected. What do you think had happened if you think about the real body in conjunction with the lower shadow ignoring the upper shadow? This is pretty much the same thing that happened with the bulls. The presence of the lower shadow tells us that the bears did attempt to take the market lower. However, they were not really successful in their endeavour. If the bears were truly successful, then the real body would have been long red candle and not really a short candle. Hence, the bears’ attempt to take the markets lower can be treated as an attempt, but they were not really successful.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now think about the spinning top as a whole along with all its components, i.e. real body, upper shadow, and lower shadow. The bulls made a futile attempt to take the market higher. The bears tried to take the markets lower, and it did not work either. Neither the bulls nor the bears could establish any influence on the market as this is evident with the small real body. Thus Spinning tops are indicative of a market where indecision and uncertainty prevails.</p>\n<p>If you look at a spinning top in isolation, it does not mean much. <strong>It just conveys indecision as both bulls and bears were not able to influence the markets.</strong> However, when you see the spinning top concerning the chart trend, it gives out a compelling message based on which you can position your stance in the markets.</p>\n<h2>6.2 – Spinning tops in a downtrend</h2>\n<p>What if the spinning tops were to occur when the stock is in a downtrend?</p>\n<p>In a downtrend, the bears are in absolute control as they manage to grind the prices lower. With the spinning top in the downtrend, the bears could be consolidating their position before resuming another bout of selling. The bulls have also attempted to arrest the price fall and have tried to hold on to their position, though not successfully. After all, if they were successful, the day would have resulted in a good blue candle and not really a spinning top.</p>\n<p>So what stance would you take considering that there are spinning tops in a downtrend? The stance depends on what we expect going forward. Clearly, there are two foreseeable situations with an equal probability:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Either there will be another round of selling.</li>\n<li>Or the markets could reverse its directions, and the prices could increase.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Clearly, with no clarity on what is likely to happen, the trader needs to be prepared for both the situations, i.e. reversal and continuation.</p>\n<p>If the trader has been waiting for an opportunity to go long on the stock, probably this could be his opportunity to do so. However, to play safe, he could test the waters with only half the quantity. If the trader wants to buy 500 shares, he could probably enter the trade with 250 shares and wait and watch the market. If the market reverses its direction, and the prices start going up, then the trader can average up by buying again. If the prices reverse, the trader would most likely have bought the stocks at the lowest prices.</p>\n<p>If the stock starts to fall, the trader can exit the trade and book a loss. At least the loss is just on half the quantity and not really on the entire quantity.</p>\n<p>Here is a chart, which shows the downtrend followed by a set of spinning tops. The stock rallied post the occurrence of the spinning top.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch6-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-542\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart1.jpg 1252w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart1-300x128.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart1-1024x438.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>Here is another chart which shows the continuation of a downtrend after the occurrence of spinning tops.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch6-Chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-543\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"227\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart2.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></p>\n<p>So, think about the spinning top as “The calm before the storm”. The storm could be in the form of a continuation or a reversal of the trend. In which way, the price will eventually move is not certain; however, what is certain is the movement itself. One needs to be prepared for both situations.</p>\n<h2>6.3 – Spinning tops in an uptrend</h2>\n<p>A spinning top in an uptrend has similar implications as the spinning top in a downtrend, except that we look at it slightly differently. Look at the chart below, what can you see and what would be the inference?</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch6-Chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-544\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"246\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart3.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>An obvious observation is that there is an uptrend in the market, which implies the bulls have been in absolute control over the last few trading sessions. However, with the occurrence of the recent spinning tops, the situation is a bit tricky:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The bulls are no longer in control; spinning tops would not be formed on the charts if they were.</li>\n<li>With the formation of spinning tops, the bears have made an entry to the markets. Though not successful, the emphasis is on the fact that the bulls gave leeway to bears.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Having observed the above, what does it actually mean, and how do you position yourself in the market?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The spinning top basically conveys indecision in the market, i.e. neither the bulls nor the bears can influence the markets.</li>\n<li>Placing the above fact in the context of an uptrend, we can conclude two things…\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The bulls could be consolidating their position before initiating another leg of the up move.</li>\n<li>Or the bulls are fatigued and may give way to bears. Hence a correction could be around the corner.</li>\n<li>The chances of both these events taking place are equal, i.e. 50%</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Having said that, what should you do? The chances of both events playing out are equal, how are you going to take a stance? Well, in such a situation, you should prepare for both the outcomes!</p>\n<p>Assume you had bought the stock before the rally started; this could be your chance to book some profits. However, you do not book profits on the entire quantity. Assume you own 500 shares; you can use this opportunity to book profits on 50% of your holding, i.e. 250 shares. Two things can happen after you do this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The bears make an entry – When this happens the market starts to slide down, and as you have booked 50% profits at a higher price, and can now choose to book profits on the balance 50% as well. Your net selling price will anyway be higher than the current market price.</li>\n<li>The bulls make an entry – It turns out that the bulls were indeed taking a pause and the rally continues, at least you are not completely out of the market as you still have the balance 50% of your holdings invested in the markets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The stance you take helps you tackle both the outcomes.</p>\n<p>Here is a chart showing an uptrend, and after spinning tops, the stock rallied. By being invested 50%, you can continue to ride the rally.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch6-Chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-545\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"191\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart4.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>To sum up, the spinning top candle shows confusion and indecision in the market with an equal probability of reversal or continuation. Until the situation becomes clear, the traders should be cautious and minimize their position size.</p>\n<h2><img alt=\"doji\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-598\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/doji.png\" width=\"131\"/>6.4 – The Dojis</h2>\n<p>The Doji’s are very similar to the spinning tops, except that it does not have a real body. This means the open and close prices are equal. Doji’s provide crucial information about the market sentiments and is an important candlestick pattern.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch6-D2a\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-593\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-D2a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-D2a.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-D2a-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>The classic definition of a Doji suggests that the open price should be equal to the close price with virtually a non-existent real body. The upper and lower wicks can be of any length.</p>\n<p>However keeping in mind the 2<sup>nd</sup> rule, i.e. ‘be flexible, verify and quantify’ even if there is a wafer-thin body, the candle can be considered a Doji.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the colour of the candle does not matter in case of a wafer-thin real body. What matters is the fact that the open and close prices were very close to each other.</p>\n<p>The Dojis have similar implications as the spinning top. Whatever we learnt for spinning tops applies to Dojis as well. In fact, more often than not, the dojis and spinning tops appear in a cluster indicating indecision in the market.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the chart below, where the dojis appears in a downtrend indicating indecision in the market before the next big move.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch6-Chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-546\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"241\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart5.jpg 1217w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart5-300x116.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart5-1024x396.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>Here is another chart where the doji appears after a healthy uptrend after which the market reverses its direction and corrects.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch6-Chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-547\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"239\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart6.jpg 1262w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart6-300x115.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch6-Chart6-1024x392.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>So the next time you see either a Spinning top or a Doji individually or in a cluster, remember there is indecision in the market. The market could swing either way, and you need to build a stance that adapts to the expected movement in the market.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A spinning top has a small real body.

The interpretation of the paper umbrella changes based on where it appears on the chart.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch7-D1a\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-600\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-D1a.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-D1a.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-D1a-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>A paper umbrella consists of two trend reversal patterns, namely the hanging man and the hammer. The hanging man pattern is bearish, and the hammer pattern is relatively bullish. A paper umbrella is characterized by a long lower shadow with a small upper body.</p>\n<p>If the paper umbrella appears at the bottom end of a downward rally, it is called the<strong> ‘Hammer’</strong>.</p>\n<p>If the paper umbrella appears at the top end of an uptrend rally, it is called the<strong> ‘Hanging Man’</strong>.</p>\n<p>To qualify a candle as a paper umbrella, the lower shadow’s length should be at least twice the length of the real body. This is called the ‘<strong>shadow to real body ratio</strong>’.</p>\n<p>Let us look at this example: Open = 100, High = 103, Low = 94, Close = 102 (bullish candle).</p>\n<p>Here, the real body’s length is <strong>Close – Open, i.e. 102-100 = 2</strong> and the length of the lower shadow is <strong>Open – Low, i.e. 100 – 94 = 6</strong>. As the length of the lower shadow is more than twice the real body; hence we can conclude that a paper umbrella has formed.</p>\n<h2>7.2 – The Hammer formation</h2>\n<p>The bullish hammer is a significant candlestick pattern that occurs at the bottom of the trend. A hammer consists of a small real body at the upper end of the trading range with a long lower shadow. The longer, the lower shadow, the more bullish the pattern.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows the presence of two hammers formed at the bottom of a downtrend.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch7-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-563\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"166\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart1.jpg 624w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart1-300x80.jpg 300w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>Notice the blue hammer has a very tiny upper shadow, which is acceptable considering the “Be flexible – quantify and verify” rule.</p>\n<p>A hammer can be of any colour as it does not really matter as long as it qualifies ‘the shadow to real body’ ratio. However, it is slightly more comforting to see a blue-coloured real body.</p>\n<p><strong>The prior trend for the hammer should be a downtrend</strong>. The prior trend is highlighted with the curved line. The thought process behind a hammer is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The market is in a downtrend, where the bears are in absolute control of the markets.</li>\n<li>During a downtrend, every day the market would open lower compared to the previous day’s close and again closes lower to form a new low</li>\n<li>On the day the hammer pattern forms, the market as expected trades lower, and makes a new low</li>\n<li>However, at the low point, some amount of buying interest emerges, which pushes the prices higher to the extent that the stock closes near the high point of the day.</li>\n<li>The price action on the hammer formation day indicates that the bulls attempted to break the prices from falling further, and were reasonably successful.</li>\n<li>This action by the bulls has the potential to change the sentiment in the stock. Hence one should look at buying opportunities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The trade setup for the hammer is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A hammer formation suggests a long trade.</li>\n<li>The trader’s entry time depends on the risk appetite of the trader. If the trader is a risk-taker, he can buy the stock the same day. Remember, the real body’s colour in hammer does not matter; hence there is no violation of Rule 1. If the trader is risk-averse, he can buy the stock the day after the pattern has formed only after ensuring that the day is a blue candle day\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Risk takers can qualify the day as a hammer by checking the following condition at 3:20 PM on the hammer day…\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>Open and close should be almost the same (within 1-2% range)</li>\n<li>Lower shadow length should be at least twice the length of the real body.</li>\n<li>If both these conditions are met, then the pattern is a hammer, and the risk-taker can go long.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The risk-averse trader should evaluate the OHLC data on the 2<sup>nd</sup> If it’s a blue candle, the trade is valid so that he can go long.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The low of the hammer acts as the stoploss for the trade.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The chart below shows a hammer’s formation where both the risk taker and the risk-averse would have set up a profitable trade.

However, the second hammer would have enticed both the risk-averse and risk-taker to enter a trade. After initiating the trade, the stock did not move up; it stayed nearly flat and cracked down eventually.</p>\n<p>Please note once you initiate the trade you stay in it until either the stop loss or the target is reached. It would help if you did not tweak the trade until one of these events occurs. The loss in this particular trade (first hammer) is inevitable. But remember this is a calculated risk and not a mere speculative risk.</p>\n<p>Here is another chart where a perfect hammer appears; however, it does not satisfy the prior trend condition, and hence <strong>it is not a defined pattern.</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch7-Chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-567\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"163\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart5.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></p>\n<h2>7.3 – The Hanging man</h2>\n<p>If a paper umbrella appears at the top end of a trend, it is called a Hanging Man. The bearish hanging man is a single candlestick and a top reversal pattern. A hanging man signals a market high. The hanging man is classified as a hanging man <strong>only if an uptrend precedes it</strong>.   Since the hanging man is seen after a high, the bearish hanging man pattern signals to sell pressure.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch7-Chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-568\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"242\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart6.jpg 1251w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart6-300x116.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart6-1024x397.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>A hanging man can be of any colour, and it does not really matter as long as it qualifies ‘the shadow to real body’ ratio. The hanging man’s prior trend <strong>should be an uptrend</strong>, as highlighted by the curved line in the chart above. The thought process behind a hanging man is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The market is in an uptrend. Hence the bulls are in absolute control.</li>\n<li>New highs and higher lows characterize the market.</li>\n<li>The day the hanging man pattern appears, the bears have managed to make an entry.</li>\n<li>This is emphasized by a long lower shadow of the hanging man.</li>\n<li>The entry of bears signifies that they are trying to break the stronghold of the bulls.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus, the hanging man makes a case for shorting the stock. The trade set up would be as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For the risk-taker, a short trade can be initiated the same day around the closing price.</li>\n<li>For the risk-averse, a short trade can be initiated at the close of the next day after ensuring that a red candle would appear.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The method to validate the candle for the risk-averse, and risk-taker is the same as explained in a hammer pattern.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once the short has been initiated, the candle’s high works as a stoploss for the trade.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch7-Chart7\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-569 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"259\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart7.jpg 1173w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart7-300x125.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart7-1024x425.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>In the chart above, BPCL Limited has formed a hanging man at 593. The OHLC details are –</p>\n<p>Open = 592, High = 593.75, Low = 587, Close = 593. Based on this, the trade set up would be as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The risk-taker initiates the short trade on the day the pattern appears (at 593)</li>\n<li>The risk-averse initiates the short trade on the next day at closing prices after ensuring it is a red candle day</li>\n<li>Both the risk-taker and the risk-averse would have initiated their respective trades</li>\n<li>The stoploss price for this trade would be the high price, i.e. above 593.75</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The trade would have been profitable for both the risk types.</p>\n<h2>7.4 –My experience with a paper umbrella</h2>\n<p>While both the hammer and the hanging man are valid candlestick patterns, my dependence on a hammer is a little more as opposed to a hanging man. All else equal, if there were two trading opportunities in the market, one based on the hammer and the other based on hanging man I would prefer to place my money on the hammer. The reason to do so is based on my experience in trading with both the patterns.</p>\n<p>My only concern with a hanging man is that if the bears were indeed influential during the day, why did the price go up after making a low? This, in my opinion, re-establishes the bull’s supremacy in the market.</p>\n<p>I would encourage you to develop your own thesis based on observations that you make in the markets. This will help you calibrate your trade more accurately and help you develop structured market thinking.</p>\n<h2><img alt=\"shooting-star\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-607\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"131\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/shooting-star.png\" width=\"131\"/>7.5 – The shooting star</h2>\n<p>The shooting star is the last single candlestick pattern that we will learn about before moving to multiple candlestick patterns. The shooting star’s price action is quite powerful, thus making the shooting star a trendy candlestick pattern to trade.</p>\n<p>The shooting star looks just like an inverted paper umbrella.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch7-Chart8\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-570\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"246\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart8.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></p>\n<p>Unlike a paper umbrella, the shooting star does not have a long lower shadow. Instead, it has a long upper shadow where the shadow’s length is at least twice the length of the real body. The body’s colour does not matter, but the pattern is slightly more reliable if the real body is red. The longer the upper wick, the more bearish is the pattern. The small real body is a common feature between the shooting star and the paper umbrella. Going by the textbook definition, the shooting star should not have a lower shadow. However, a small lower shadow, as seen in the chart above, is considered alright. The shooting star is a bearish pattern; <strong>hence the prior trend should be bullish</strong>.</p>\n<p>The thought process behind the shooting star is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The stock is in an uptrend implying that the bulls are in absolute control. When bulls are in control, the stock or the market tends to make a new high and higher low.</li>\n<li>On the day the shooting star pattern forms, the market as expected trades higher, and in the process makes a new high</li>\n<li>However, at the high point of the day, there is a selling pressure where the stock price recedes to close near the low point of the day, thus forming a shooting star.</li>\n<li>The selling indicates that the bears have made an entry, and they were actually quite successful in pushing the prices down. This is evident by the long upper shadow.</li>\n<li>The expectation is that the bears will continue selling over the next few trading sessions. Hence the traders should look for shorting opportunities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Take a look at this chart where a shooting star has been formed right at the top of an uptrend.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch7-Chart9\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-571\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"271\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart9.jpg 623w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart9-300x130.jpg 300w\" width=\"623\"/></p>\n<p>The OHLC data on the shooting star is; open = 1426, high = 1453, low = 1410, close = 1417. The short trade set up on this would be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The risk-taker will initiate the trade-in 1417, basically on the same day the shooting star forms.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The risk-taker initiates the trade the same day after ensuring that the day has formed a shooting star. To confirm this, the trader has to validate:\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>If the current market price is more or less equal to the low price</li>\n<li>The length of the upper shadow is at least twice the length of the real body.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The risk-averse will initiate the trade on the next day, only after ensuring that the 2<sup>nd</sup> day a red candle has formed.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Once the trade has been initiated, the stoploss is to be placed at the pattern’s high. In the case, the stop loss is at 1453</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As we have discussed this before, once a trade has been set up, we should wait for either the stoploss or the target to be triggered. It is advisable not to do anything else, except for maybe trailing your stoploss. Of course, we still haven’t discussed trailing stoploss yet. We will discuss it at a later stage.</p>\n<p>Here is a chart where both the risk taker and the risk-averse would have made a remarkable profit on a trade based on a shooting star.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch7-Chart10\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-572\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"301\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart10.jpg 622w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch7-Chart10-300x145.jpg 300w\" width=\"622\"/></p>\n<p>Here is an example, where both the risk-averse and the risk-taker would have initiated the trade based on a shooting star.

However, when analyzing multiple candlestick patterns, the trader needs 2 or sometimes 3 candlesticks to identify a trading opportunity. This means the trading opportunity evolves over a minimum of 2 trading sessions.</p>\n<p>The engulfing pattern is the first multiple candlestick patterns that we need to look into. The engulfing pattern needs 2 trading sessions to evolve. In a typical engulfing pattern, you will find a small candle on day 1 and a relatively long candle on day 2, which appears as if it engulfs the candle on day 1. If the engulfing pattern appears at the bottom of the trend, it is called the “Bullish Engulfing” pattern. If the engulfing pattern appears at the top end of the trend, it is called the “Bearish Engulfing” pattern.</p>\n<h2>8.2 – The Bullish Engulfing Pattern</h2>\n<p>The bullish engulfing pattern is a two candlestick pattern which appears at the bottom of the downtrend. As the name suggests, this is a bullish pattern which prompts the trader to go long. The two-day bullish engulfing pattern is encircled in the chart below. The prerequisites for the pattern are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The prior trend should be a downtrend</li>\n<li>The first day of the pattern (P1) should be a red candle reconfirming the bearishness in the market</li>\n<li>The candle on the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of the pattern (P2) should be blue, long enough to engulf the red candle</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"M2Ch8-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-643 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"233\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart1.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>The thought process behind the bullish engulfing pattern is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The market is in a downtrend with prices steadily moving down</li>\n<li>On the first day of the pattern (P1), the market opens low and makes a new low. This forms a red candle in the process</li>\n<li>On the second day of the pattern (P2), the stock opens near the closing prices of P1 and attempts to make a new low. However, there is a sudden buying interest at this low point of the day, which drives the prices to close higher than the previous day’s open. This price action forms a blue candle</li>\n<li>The price action on P2 also suggests that bulls made a very sudden and strong attempt to break the bearish trend, and they did so quite successfully. This is evident by the long blue candle on P2</li>\n<li>The bears would not have expected the bull’s sudden action on P2 and hence the bull’s action kind of rattles the bears causing them some amount of nervousness</li>\n<li>The bullishness is expected to continue over the next few successive trading sessions, driving the prices higher and hence the trader should look for buying opportunities</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The trade set up for the bullish engulfing pattern is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The bullish engulfing pattern evolves over two days</li>\n<li>The suggested buy price is around the close price of the blue candle, i.e. on P2\n<ul>\n<li>Risk-taker initiates the trade on P2 itself after ensuring P2 is engulfing P1</li>\n<li>The risk-averse initiates the trade on the next day, i.e. the day after P2 around the closing price, after confirming the day is forming a blue candle</li>\n<li>If the day after P2 is a red candle day, the risk-averse trader will ignore the trade, owing to rule 1 of candlesticks (Buy strength and Sell weakness)</li>\n<li>On a personal note, in multiple candlestick patterns where the trade evolves over 2 or more days, it is worth to be a risk-taker as opposed to a risk-averse trader</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The stop loss for the trade would be at the lowest low between P1 and P2</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Needless to say, once the trade has been initiated, you will have to wait until the target has been hit or the stoploss has been breached. Of course, one can always trail the stop loss to lock in profits.</p>\n<p>Have a look at DLF’s chart below; the bullish engulfing pattern is encircled.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2Ch8-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-655\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"210\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart21.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></p>\n<p>The OHLC on <strong>P1 </strong>– Open = 163, High = 168, Low = 158.5, Close = 160. On <strong>P2</strong> the OHLC details are – Open = 159.5, High = 170.2, Low = 159, Close = 169.</p>\n<p>The trade set up for the bullish engulfing pattern is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The risk-taker would go long on P2 at 169. He can do this by validating P2 as an engulfing pattern. To validate P2 as an engulfing pattern, there are 2 conditions:\n<ul>\n<li>One, the current market price at 3:20 PM on P2 should be higher than P1’s open.</li>\n<li>Second, the open on P2 should be equal to or lower than P1’s close.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The risk-averse will initiate the trade, the day after P2 only after ensuring that the day is a blue candle day. So if the P1 falls on a Monday, the risk-averse would be initiating the trade on Wednesday, around 3:20 PM. However, as I had mentioned earlier, while trading based on multiple candlestick patterns, it may be worth initiating the trade on pattern completion day itself, i.e. P2</li>\n<li>The stop loss on this trade will be the lowest low between P1 and P2. In this example, the lowest low falls on P1 at 158.5</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this example, both the risk-averse and the risk-taker would have been profitable.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a perfect bullish engulfing pattern formed on Cipla Ltd, the risk-averse trader would have completely missed out a great trading opportunity.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2Ch8-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-645\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"216\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart3.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></p>\n<p>There is often a lot of confusion on whether the candle should engulf just the real body or the whole candle, including the lower and upper shadows. As long as the real bodies are engulfed in my personal experience, I would be happy to classify the candle as a bullish engulfing pattern. Of course, candlestick sticklers would object to this but what really matters is how well you hone your trading skills with a particular candlestick pattern.</p>\n<p>So going by that thought, I’d be happy to classify the following pattern as a bullish engulfing pattern, even though the shadows are not engulfed.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2Ch8-chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-646\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"312\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart4.jpg 624w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart4-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<h2>8.3 – The bearish engulfing pattern</h2>\n<p>The bearish engulfing pattern is a two candlestick pattern that appears at the top end of the trend, making it a bearish pattern. The thought process remains very similar to the bullish engulfing pattern, except one has to think about it from a shorting perspective.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the chart below, the two candles that make up the bearish engulfing pattern is encircled. You will notice:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2Ch8-chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-647\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"259\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart5.jpg 624w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart5-300x125.jpg 300w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<ol>\n<li>To begin with, the bulls are in absolute control, pushing the prices higher.</li>\n<li>On P1, as expected, the market moves up and makes a new high, reconfirming a bullish trend in the market.</li>\n<li>On P2, as expected, the market opens higher and attempts to make a new high. However, at this high point, selling pressure starts. This selling comes unexpected and hence tends to displace the bulls.</li>\n<li>The sellers push the prices lower, so much so that the stock closes below the previous day’s (P1) open. This creates nervousness amongst the bulls.</li>\n<li>The strong sell on P2 indicates that the bears may have successfully broken down the bull’s stronghold and the market may continue to witness selling pressure over the next few days.</li>\n<li>The idea is to short the index or the stock to capitalize on the expected downward slide in prices.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The trade set up would be as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The bearish engulfing pattern suggests a short trade.</li>\n<li>The risk-taker initiates the trade on the same day after validating two conditions.\n<ul>\n<li>The open on P2 is higher than P1’s close.</li>\n<li>The current market price at 3:20 PM on P2 is lower than P1’s open price. If the two conditions are satisfied, then it would be logical to conclude that it is a bearish engulfing pattern.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The risk-averse will initiate the trade on the day after P2 only after ensuring that it is a red candle day.</li>\n<li>Since the bearish engulfing pattern is a 2-day pattern, it makes sense to be a risk-taker. However, this purely depends on the individual’s risk appetite.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Take a look at the chart below of Ambuja Cements. There are two bearish engulfing patterns formed. The first pattern on the chart (encircled, starting from left) did not favour a risk-taker. However, the risk-averse would have completely avoided taking the trade. The second bearish engulfing pattern would have been profitable for both the risk taker and the risk-averse.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2Ch8-chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-648\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"209\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart6.jpg 623w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart6-300x101.jpg 300w\" width=\"623\"/></p>\n<p>The OHLC data for the bearing engulfing pattern (encircled at the top end of the chart) is as below:</p>\n<p>P1: Open – 214, High – 220, Low – 213.3, Close – 218.75</p>\n<p>P2: Open – 220, High – 221, Low – 207.3, Close – 209.4</p>\n<p>The trade setup for the short trade, based on the bearish engulfing pattern is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On P2 by 3:20 PM the risk-taker would initiate the short trade at 209 after ensuring P1, and P2 together form a bearish engulfing pattern.</li>\n<li>The risk-averse will initiate the trade, the day after P2 only after ensuring that the day is a red candle day.</li>\n<li>The stoploss in both cases will be the highest high of P1 and P2, which in this case is at 221.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both the risk-averse and the risk-taker would have been profitable in this particular case.</p>\n<h2>8.4 – The presence of a doji</h2>\n<p>Now here is a fascinating chart. From my own personal experience, I can tell you, charts like the one shown below are highly profitable. One should not miss such trading opportunities</p>\n<p>Take a look at the chart, what are the things that catch your attention?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An obvious uptrend as highlighted</li>\n<li>A bearish engulfing pattern right at the top end of the upward rally</li>\n<li>A doji formation on the day following P2</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What implication would a doji have in this chart?</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2Ch8-chart7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-649\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"237\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart7.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></p>\n<p>Let us inspect this chart event by event:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A prolonged uptrend in the chart confirms the bulls are in absolute control.</li>\n<li>On P1, a blue candle is formed, reconfirming the bull’s dominance in the markets.</li>\n<li>On P2 markets open higher and make a new high comforting the bulls. However, at the high point, a strong surge to sell builds up, to the extent that the prices close below P1’s opening prices.</li>\n<li>This trading action on P2 sets in a bit of panic to bulls, but they are not shaken yet.</li>\n<li>On day 3, let us call it as P3, though the opening is weak it is not much lower than P2’s close. This is not too comforting for the bulls, as they expect the markets to be stronger.</li>\n<li>During P3, the market attempts to move higher (Doji’s upper shadow); however, the high is not sustained. Even the low is not sustained and eventually, the day closes flat, forming a Doji. As you may recall, Dojis indicate indecision in the market.</li>\n<li>On P2 bulls panicked and on P3 bulls were uncertain.</li>\n<li>Panic with uncertainty is the perfect recipe for a catastrophe. Which explains the long red candle following the Doji</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From my own personal trading experience, I can tell you that whenever a doji follows a recognizable candlestick pattern, the opportunity created is bigger. Besides illustrating this point, I also want to draw your attention to chart analysis methodology. Notice in this particular chart, we did not just look at what was happening on P1 or P2. Still, we went beyond that and actually combined two different patterns to develop a comprehensive market view.</p>\n<h2>8.5 – The Piercing Pattern</h2>\n<p>The piercing pattern is very similar to the bullish engulfing pattern with a minor variation. In a bullish engulfing pattern, the P2’s blue candle engulfs P1’s red candle. However in a piercing pattern P2’s blue candle partially engulfs P1’s red candle. However, engulfing should be between 50% and less than 100%. You can validate this visually or calculate the same. For example, if P1’s range (Open-Close) is 12, P2’s range should be at least 6 or higher,r but below 12.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2Ch8-chart8\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-650\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"199\" sizes=\"(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart8.jpg 518w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart8-300x115.jpg 300w\" width=\"518\"/></p>\n<p>As long as this condition is satisfied, everything else is similar to the bullish engulfing, including the trade set up. Here a risk-taker would initiate the trade on P2 around the close. The risk-averse would initiate the trade, the day after P2 only after ensuring a blue candle is formed. The stoploss would be the low of the pattern.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the following chart:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2Ch8-chart9\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-651\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"204\" sizes=\"(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart9.jpg 502w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart9-300x122.jpg 300w\" width=\"502\"/></p>\n<p>Here P2’s blue candle engulfs just under 50% of P1’s red candle. For this reason, we do not consider this as a piercing pattern.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2Ch8-chart10\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-652\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"212\" sizes=\"(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart10.jpg 610w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart10-300x104.jpg 300w\" width=\"610\"/></p>\n<h2>8.6 – The Dark Cloud Cover</h2>\n<p>The dark cloud cover is very similar to the bearish engulfing pattern with a minor variation. In a bearish engulfing pattern the red candle on P2 engulfs P1’s blue candle. However, in a dark cloud cover, the red candle on P2 engulfs about 50 to 100% of P1’s blue candle. The trade set up is the same as the bearish engulfing pattern. Think about the dark cloud cover as the inverse of a piercing pattern.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2Ch8-chart11\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-653\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"316\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch8-chart11.jpg\" width=\"588\"/></p>\n<h2>8.7 – A perspective on selecting a trade</h2>\n<p>Typically stocks in the same sector have similar price movement. For example, think about TCS and Infosys or ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank. Their price movement is similar because they are more or less of the same size, have a similar business, and have the same external factors that affect their business. However, this does not mean their stock price movement would match point to point. For example, if there is negative news in the banking sector, banking stocks are bound to fall. In such a scenario if the stock price of ICICI Bank falls by 2%, it is not really necessary that HDFC Bank’s stock price should also fall exactly 2%. Probably HDFC Bank stock price may fall by 1.5% or 2.5%. Hence the two stocks may form 2 different (but somewhat similar) candlestick patterns such as a bearish engulfing and dark cloud cover at the same time.</p>\n<p>Both these are recognisable candlestick patterns, but I chose between the two patterns to set up a trade. I would put my money on the bearish engulfing pattern as opposed to a dark cloud cover. This is because the bearishness in a bearish engulfing pattern is more pronounced (because it engulfs the previous day’s entire candle). On the same lines, I would choose a bullish engulfing pattern over a piercing pattern.</p>\n<p>However, there is an exception to this selection criterion. Later in this module, I will introduce a 6 point trading checklist. A trade should satisfy at least 3 to 4 points on this checklist to be considered a qualified trade. Keeping this point in perspective, assume a situation where the ICICI Bank stock forms a piercing pattern, and the HDFC Bank stock forms a bullish engulfing pattern. Naturally, one would be tempted to trade the bullish engulfing pattern, however, if the HDFC Bank stock satisfies 3 checklist points, and ICICI Bank stock satisfies 4 checklist points, I would go ahead ICICI Bank stock even though it forms a less convincing candlestick pattern.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if both the stocks satisfy 4 checklist points, I will go ahead with the HDFC Bank trade.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Multiple candlestick patterns evolve over two or more trading days.</li>\n<li>The bullish engulfing pattern evolves over two trading days.

Apparently, it is the old Japanese word for ‘pregnant’. You’d appreciate the intuitiveness of this word when you see the candlestick formation.</p>\n<p>Harami is a two candle pattern. The first candle is usually long, and the second candle has a small body. The second candle is generally opposite in colour to the first candle. On the appearance of the harami pattern, a trend reversal is possible. There are two types of harami patterns – the bullish harami and the bearish harami.</p>\n<h2>9.2 – The Bullish Harami</h2>\n<p>As the name suggests, the bullish harami is a bullish pattern appearing at the bottom end of the chart. The bullish harami pattern evolves over a two day period, similar to the engulfing pattern.</p>\n<p>In the chart below, the bullish harami pattern is encircled.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch9-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-762\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"222\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch9-chart1.jpg\" width=\"604\"/></strong></p>\n<p>The thought process behind a bullish harami pattern is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The market is in a downtrend pushing the prices lower, giving the bears absolute control over the markets.</li>\n<li>On day 1 of the pattern (P1), a red candle with a new low is formed, reinforcing the bear’s position in the market.</li>\n<li>On day 2 of the pattern (P2), the market opens at a price higher than the previous day’s close. On seeing a high opening price, the bears panic, as they would have otherwise expected a lower opening price.</li>\n<li>The market gains strength on P2 and manages to close on a positive note, thus forming a blue candle. However, P2’s closing price is just below the previous days (P1) open price.</li>\n<li>The price action on P2 creates a small blue candle which appears contained (pregnant) within P1’s long red candle.</li>\n<li>The small blue candle on a standalone basis looks harmless, but what really causes the panic is that the bullish candle appears suddenly when it is least expected.</li>\n<li>The blue candle not only encourages the bulls to build long positions but also unnerves the bears.</li>\n<li>The expectation is that panic amongst the bears will spread faster, giving a greater push to bulls. This tends to push the prices higher. Hence one should look at going long on the stock.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The trade setup for the bullish harami is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The idea is to go long on the bullish harami formation.</li>\n<li>Risk takers can initiate a long trade around the close of the P2 candle.</li>\n<li>Risk takers can validate the following conditions to confirm if P1 and P2 together form a bullish harami pattern:\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The opening on P2 should be higher than the close of P1.</li>\n<li>The current market price at 3:20 PM on P2 should be less than P1’s opening price.</li>\n<li>If both these conditions are satisfied, one can conclude that both P1 and P2 form a bullish harami pattern.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The risk-averse can initiate a long trade at the close of the day after P2, only after confirming that the day is forming a blue candle.</li>\n<li>The lowest low of the pattern will be the stoploss for the trade.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is a chart of Axis Bank; the bullish harami is encircled below:</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch9-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-763\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"200\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch9-chart2.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>The OHLC details for the pattern are as follows:</p>\n<p>P1 – Open = 868, High = 874, Low = 810, Close = 815<br/>\nP2 – Open = 824, High = 847, Low = 818, Close = 835</p>\n<p>The risk-taker would initiate the long position at the close of P2, which is around 835.

Gaps (a general term used to indicate both gaps up and gap down) are a common price behaviour.  A daily chart gap happens when the stock closes at one price but opens on the following day at a different price.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2Ch10-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-732\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch10-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch10-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch10-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>10.1 – The Gaps</h2>\n<p><strong>Gap up the opening – </strong>A gap up opening indicates buyer’s enthusiasm. Buyers are willing to buy stocks at a price higher than the previous day’s close. Hence, the stock (or the index) opens directly above the previous day’s close because of the enthusiastic buyer’s outlook. For example, consider the closing price of ABC Ltd was Rs.100 on Monday. After the market closes on Monday assume ABC Ltd announces their quarterly results. The numbers are so good that the buyers are willing to buy the stock at any price on Tuesday morning. This enthusiasm would lead to stock price jumping to Rs.104 directly. This means there was no trading activity between Rs.100 and Rs.104, yet the stock jumped to Rs.104. This is called a gap up opening.  Gap up opening portrays bullish sentiment.</p>\n<p>In the following image, the green arrows point to a gap up openings.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch10-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-769\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"219\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart1.jpg 1217w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart1-300x117.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart1-1024x400.jpg 1024w\" width=\"561\"/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Gap down opening – </strong>Similar to gap up opening, a gap down opening shows the bears’ enthusiasm. The bears are so eager to sell that they are willing to sell at a price lower than the previous day’s close. In the example stated above, if the quarterly results were bad, the sellers would want to get rid of the stock and hence the market on Tuesday could open directly at Rs.95 instead of Rs.100. In this case, though there was no trading activity between Rs.100 and Rs.95, the stock plummeted to Rs.95. Gap down opening portrays bearish sentiment. In the following image, the green arrows point to a gap down opening.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch10-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-770\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"218\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart2.jpg 1176w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart2-300x105.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart2-1024x357.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<h2>10.2 – The Morning Star</h2>\n<p>The morning star is a bullish candlestick pattern which evolves over a three day period. It is a downtrend reversal pattern. The pattern is formed by combining 3 consecutive candlesticks. The morning star appears at the bottom end of a downtrend. In the chart below the morning, the star is encircled.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch10-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-771\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"148\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart3.jpg 605w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart3-300x73.jpg 300w\" width=\"605\"/></p>\n<p>The morning star pattern involves 3 candlesticks sequenced in a particular order. The pattern is encircled in the chart above. The thought process behind the morning star is as follow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The market is in a downtrend placing the bears in absolute control. The market makes successive new lows during this period.</li>\n<li>On day 1 of the pattern (P1), as expected, the market makes a new low and forms a long red candle. The large red candle shows selling acceleration.</li>\n<li>On day 2 of the pattern (P2), the bears show dominance with a gap down opening. This reaffirms the position of the bears.</li>\n<li>After the gap down opening, nothing much happens during the day (P2) resulting in either a doji or a spinning top. Note the presence of doji/spinning top represents indecision in the market.</li>\n<li>The occurrence of a doji/spinning sets in a bit of restlessness within the bears, as they would have otherwise expected another down day especially in the backdrop of a promising gap down opening.</li>\n<li>On the third day of the pattern (P3), the market/stock opens with a gap, followed by a blue candle that manages to close above P1’s red candle opening.</li>\n<li>In the absence of P2’s doji/spinning top, it would have appeared as though P1 and P3 formed a bullish engulfing pattern.</li>\n<li>P3 is where all the action unfolds. On the gap up opening itself, the bears would have been a bit jittery. Encouraged by the gap up opening buying persists through the day, so much so that it manages to recover all the losses of P1.</li>\n<li>The expectation is that the bullishness on P3 is likely to continue over the next few trading sessions, and hence one should look at buying opportunities in the market.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unlike the single and two candlestick patterns, both the risk taker and the risk-averse trader can initiate the trade on P3 itself. Waiting for a confirmation on the 4<sup>th</sup> day may not be necessary while trading based on a morning star pattern.</p>\n<p>The long trade setup for a morning star would be as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Initiate a long trade at the close of P3 (around 3:20 PM) after ensuring that P1, P2, and P3 together form a morning star</li>\n<li>To validate the formation of a morning star on P3, the following conditions should satisfy:\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>P1 should be a red candle</li>\n<li>With a gap down opening, P2 should be either a doji or a spinning top</li>\n<li>P3 opening should be a gap up, plus the current market price at 3:20 PM should be higher than the opening of P1</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The lowest low in the pattern would act as a stop loss for the trade</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>10.3 – The evening star</h2>\n<p>The evening star is the last candlestick pattern that we would learn in this module.</p>\n<p>The evening star is a bearish equivalent of the morning star. The evening star appears at the top end of an uptrend. Like the morning star, the evening star is a three candle formation and evolves over three trading sessions.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch10-chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-772\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"276\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart4.jpg 615w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch10-chart4-300x135.jpg 300w\" width=\"615\"/></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The reasons to go short on an evening star are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The market is in an uptrend placing the bulls in absolute control</li>\n<li>During an uptrend, the market/stock makes new highs</li>\n<li>On the first day of the pattern (P1), as expected, the market opens high, makes a new high, and closes near the day’s high point. The long blue candle formed on day 1 (P1) shows buying acceleration</li>\n<li>On the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of the pattern (P2), the market opens with a gap reconfirming the bull’s stance in the market. However, after the encouraging open, the market/stock does not move and closes by forming a doji/spinning top. The closing on P2 sets in a bit of panic for bulls</li>\n<li>On the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of the pattern (P3), the market opens gap down and progresses into a red candle. The long red candle indicates that the sellers are taking control. The price action on P3 sets the bulls in panic</li>\n<li>The expectation is that the bulls will continue to panic, and hence the bearishness will continue over the next few trading session. Therefore one should look at shorting opportunities</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The trade setup for an evening star is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Short the stock on P3, around the close of 3:20 PM after validating that P1 to P3 form an evening star</li>\n<li>To validate the evening star formation on day 3, one has to evaluate the following:\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>P1 should be a blue candle</li>\n<li>P2 should be a doji or a spinning top with a gap up opening</li>\n<li>P3 should be a red candle with a gap down opening. The current market price at 3:20 PM on P3 should be lower than the opening price of P1</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Both risk-taker and risk-averse can initiate the trade on P3</li>\n<li>The stop loss for the trade will be the highest high of P1, P2, and P3.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>10.4 – Summarizing the entry and exit for candlestick patterns</h2>\n<p>Before we conclude this chapter let us summarize the entry and stop loss for both long and short trades. Remember, during the candlesticks study, we have not dealt with the trade exit (aka targets). We will do so in the next chapter.</p>\n<p>Risk-taker – The risk-taker enters the trade on the last day of the pattern formation around the closing price (3:20 PM). The trader should validate the pattern rules and if the rules are validated; then the opportunity qualifies as a trade.</p>\n<p>Risk-averse – The risk-averse trader will initiate the trade after he identifies a confirmation on the following day. For a long trade, the candle’s colour should be blue, and for a short trade, the candle’s colour should be red.</p>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, the higher the number of days involved in a pattern, the better it is to initiate the trade on the same day.</p>\n<p>The stoploss for a long trade is the lowest low of the pattern. The stoploss for a short trade is the highest high of the pattern.</p>\n<h2>10.5 – What next?</h2>\n<p>We have looked at 16 candlestick patterns, and is that all you may wonder?.</p>\n<p>No, not really. There are many candlestick patterns, and I could go on explaining these patterns, but that would defeat the ultimate goal.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal is to understand and recognize that candlesticks are a way of thinking about the markets. You need not know all the patterns.</p>\n<p>Think about car driving; once you learn how to drive a car, it does not matter which car you drive. Driving a Honda is pretty much the same as driving a Hyundai or Ford. Driving comes naturally irrespective of which car you are driving. Likewise, once you train your mind to read the thought process behind a candlestick, it does not matter which pattern you see. You will know how to react and set up a trade based on the chart you are seeing. Of course, to reach this stage, you will have to go through the rigour of learning and trading the standard patterns.</p>\n<p>So my advice to you would be to know the patterns that we have discussed here. They are some of the most frequent and profitable patterns to trade on the Indian markets. As you progress, start developing trades based on the thought process behind the bulls’ actions and the bears. This, over time, is probably the best approach to study candlesticks.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Star formation occurs over three trading sessions. The candle of P2 is usually a doji or a spinning top.</li>\n<li>If there is a doji on P2 in a star pattern, it is called a doji star (morning doji star, evening doji star) else it is just called the star pattern (morning star, evening star)</li>\n<li>Morning star is a bullish pattern which occurs at the bottom end of the trend. The idea is to go long on P3 with the lowest low pattern being the stop loss for the trade.</li>\n<li>The evening star is a bearish pattern, which occurs at the top end of an uptrend. The idea is to go short on P3, with the highest pattern acting as a stop loss.</li>\n<li>The star formation evolves over a 3 days period. Hence both the risk-averse and risk taker are advised to initiate the trade on P3.</li>\n<li>Candlesticks portray the traders thought process. One should nurture this thought process as he dwells deeper into the candlestick study</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

We will discuss the same in this chapter.</p>\n<p>The best way to identify the target price is to identify the support and resistance points. The support and resistance (S&amp;R) are specific price points on a chart expected to attract the maximum amount of either buying or selling. The support price is a price at which one can expect more buyers than sellers. Likewise, the resistance price is a price at which one can expect more sellers than buyers.</p>\n<p>On a standalone basis, traders can use S&amp;R to identify trade entry points as well.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch11-title1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-758\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"209\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-title1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-title1.jpg 308w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-title1-300x204.jpg 300w\" width=\"308\"/></p>\n<h2>11.1 – The Resistance</h2>\n<p>As the name suggests, resistance is something which stops the price from rising further. The resistance level is a price point on the chart where traders expect maximum supply (in terms of selling) for the stock/index. <strong>The resistance level is always above the current market price.</strong></p>\n<p>The likelihood of the price rising to the resistance level, consolidating, absorbing all the supply, and declining is high. The resistance is one of the critical technical analysis tools which market participants look at in a rising market. The resistance often acts as a trigger to sell.</p>\n<p>Here is the chart of Ambuja Cements Limited. The horizontal line coinciding at Rs.215 on the chart, marks the resistance level for Ambuja Cements.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch11-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-775\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"228\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart1.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p>I have deliberately compressed the chart to include more data points, the reasons for which I will shortly explain. But before that there are two things that you need to pay attention to while looking at the above chart:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The resistance level, indicated by a horizontal line, is higher than the current market price.</li>\n<li>While the resistance level is at 215, the current candle is at 206.75. The current candle and its corresponding price level are encircled for your reference</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For a moment let us imagine Ambuja cement at Rs.206 forming a bullish marubuzo with a low of 202. We know this is a signal to initiate a long trade, and we also know that the stoploss for this trade is at 202. With the new-found knowledge on resistance, we now know that we can set 215 as a possible target for this trade!</p>\n<p>Why 215 you may wonder? The reasons are simple:-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The resistance of 215 implies there is a likelihood of excess supply.</li>\n<li>Excess supply builds selling pressure.</li>\n<li>Selling pressure tends to drag the prices lower.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hence for reasons stated above, when a trader is long, he can look at resistance points to set targets and to set exit points for the trade.</p>\n<p>Also, with the identification of the resistance, the long trade can now be completely designed as follows:</p>\n<p>Entry – 206, Stoploss – 202, and Target – 215.</p>\n<p>The next obvious question is, how do we identify the resistance level? Identifying price points as either a support or resistance is extremely simple. The identification process is the same for both support and resistance. If the current market price is below the identified point, it is called a resistance point; else it is called a support point.</p>\n<p>Since the process is the same, let us proceed to understand ‘support’, and we will follow it up with the procedure to identify S&amp;R.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch11-title2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-759\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"162\" sizes=\"(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-title2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-title2.jpg 308w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-title2-300x158.jpg 300w\" width=\"308\"/></p>\n<h2>11.2 – The Support</h2>\n<p>Having learnt about resistance, understanding the support level should be quite simple and intuitive. As the name suggests, support is something that prevents the price from falling further. The support level is a price point on the chart where the trader expects maximum demand (in terms of buying) coming into the stock/index. Whenever the price falls to the support line, it is likely to bounce back. The support level is <strong>always below</strong> the current market price.</p>\n<p>There is a maximum likelihood that the price could fall until the support, consolidate, absorb all the demand, and then start moving upwards. The support is one of the critical technical level market participants look for in a falling market. The support often acts as a trigger to buy.</p>\n<p>Here is the chart of Cipla Limited. The horizontal line coinciding at 435 on the chart marks the support level for Cipla.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch11-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-776\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"287\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart2.jpg 1036w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart2-300x138.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart2-1024x471.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>Few things that you need to notice on the chart above:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The support level, indicated by the horizontal line is below the current market price.</li>\n<li>While the support level is at 435, the current candle is at 442.5. The current candle and its corresponding price level are encircled for your reference</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Like we did while understanding resistance, let us imagine a bearish pattern formation – perhaps a shooting star at 442 with a high of 446. Clearly, with a shooting star,  the call is too short Cipla at 442, with 446 as the stoploss. Since we know 435 the immediate support, we can set the target at 435.</p>\n<p>So what makes Rs.435 target worthy? The following reasons back the decision:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Support at 435 implies there is a maximum likely hood of excess demand to emerge.</li>\n<li>Excess demand builds buying pressure.</li>\n<li>Buying pressure tends to drag the price higher.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hence for the reasons stated above, when a trader is short, he can look at support points to set targets and to set exit points for the trade.</p>\n<p>Also, with the identification of the support, the short trade is now completely designed.</p>\n<p>Entry – 442, stoploss – 446, and target – 435.</p>\n<h2>11.3 – Construction/Drawing of the Support and Resistance level</h2>\n<p>Here is a 4 step guide to help you understand how to identify and construct the support and the resistance line.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1) Load data points</strong> – If the objective is to identify short term S&amp;R load at least 3-6 months of data points. If you want to identify long term S&amp;R, load at least 12 – 18 months of data points. When you load many data points, the chart looks compressed. This also explains why the above two charts look squeezed.</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Long term S&amp;R – is useful for swing trading.</li>\n<li>Short term S&amp;R – is useful intraday and BTST trades.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is a chart where I have loaded 12 months of data points</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch11-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-777\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"228\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart3.jpg 623w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart3-300x110.jpg 300w\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Step 2) Identify at least 3 price action zones – </strong>A price action zone can be described as ‘sticky points’ on the chart where the price has displayed at least one of the behaviours:</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Hesitated to move up further after a brief up move</li>\n<li>Hesitated to move down further after a brief down move</li>\n<li>Sharp reversals at a particular price point</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are a series of charts that identifies the above 3 points in the same order:</p>\n<p>In the chart below, the encircled points indicate the price hesitating to move up further after a brief up move:</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch11-chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-778\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"228\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart4.jpg 623w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart4-300x110.jpg 300w\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p>In the chart below, the encircled points indicate the price hesitating to move down further after a brief down move:</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch11-chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-779\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"228\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart5.jpg 623w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart5-300x110.jpg 300w\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p>In the chart below, the encircled points indicate sharp price reversals:</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch11-chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-780\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"228\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart6.jpg 1317w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart6-300x110.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart6-1024x377.jpg 1024w\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Step 3) Align the price action zones – </strong>When you look at a 12-month chart, it is common to spot many price action zones. But the trick is to identify at least 3 price action zones at the same price level.</p>\n<p>For example here is a chart where two price action zones are identified, but they are not at the same price point.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch11-chart7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-781\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart7.jpg 1114w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart7-300x128.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart7-1024x438.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Look at the following chart, I have encircled 3 price action zones that are around the same price points:</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch11-chart8\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-782\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"226\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart8.jpg 1317w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart8-300x109.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart8-1024x371.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>A critical point to note while identifying these price action zones is to make sure these price zones are well spaced in time. Meaning, if the 1<sup>st</sup> price action zone is identified on 2<sup>nd</sup> week on May, then it will be meaningful to identify the 2<sup>nd</sup> price action zone at any point after 4<sup>th</sup> week of May (well spaced in time). The more distance between two price action zones, the more powerful is the S&amp;R identification.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4)</strong> <strong>Fit a horizontal line – </strong>Connect the three price action zones with a horizontal line<strong>. </strong>Based on where this line fits in concerning the current market price, it either becomes support or resistance.</p>\n<p>Have a look at this chart</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch11-chart9\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-783\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"230\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart9.jpg 1294w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart9-300x111.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart9-1024x377.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>Starting from left:</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The 1st circle highlights a price action zone where there is a sharp reversal of price.</li>\n<li>The 2nd circle highlights a price action zone where the price is sticky.</li>\n<li>The 3<sup>rd</sup> circle highlights a price action zone where there is a sharp reversal of price.</li>\n<li>The 4<sup>th</sup> circle highlights a price action zone where the price is sticky.</li>\n<li>The 5<sup>th</sup> circle highlights the current market price of Cipla – 442.5</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the above chart, all the 4 price action zones are around the same price points, i.e. at 429. Clearly, the horizontal line is below the current market price of 442.5, making 429 an immediate support price for Cipla.</p>\n<p>Please note that whenever you run a visual exercise in Technical Analysis such as identifying S&amp;R, you run the approximation risk. Hence always give room for error. The price level is usually depicted in a range and not at a single price point. It is actually a zone or an area that acts as support or resistance.</p>\n<p>Going by the above logic, I would be happy to consider a price range around 426 to 432 as a support region for Cipla. There is no specific rule for this range; I just subtracted and added 3 points to 429 to get my price range for the support!</p>\n<p>Here is another chart, where both S&amp;R have been identified for Ambuja Cements Limited.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch11-chart10\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-784 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"289\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch11-chart10.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p>The current price of Ambuja is 204.1, the support is identified at 201 (below current market price), and the resistance at 214 (above current market price). So if one were too short Ambuja at 204, the target, based on support, can be at 201. Probably this would be a good intraday trade. For a trader going long at 204, 214 can be a reasonable target expectation based on resistance.</p>\n<p>Notice in both the support and the resistance level, there at least 3 price action zone identified at the price level, all of which are well spaced in time.</p>\n<h2>11.4 – Reliability of S&amp;R</h2>\n<p>The support and resistance lines are only indicative of a possible reversal of prices. They by no means should be taken for ascertain. Like anything else in technical analysis, one should weigh the possibility of an event occurring (based on patterns) in terms of probability.</p>\n<p>For example, based on the chart of Ambuja Cements –</p>\n<p>Current Market Price = 204<br/>\nResistance = 214</p>\n<p>The expectation here is that if Ambuja cement starts to move up at all, it is likely to face resistance at 214. Meaning, at 214 sellers could emerge who can potentially drag the prices lower. What is the guarantee that the sellers would come in at 214? In other words, what is the dependence of the resistance line? Honestly, your guess is as good as mine.</p>\n<p>However, historically it can be seen that whenever Ambuja reached 214, it reacted in a peculiar way leading to the formation of a price action zone. The comforting factor here is that the price action zone is well spaced in time. This mean 214 <strong>stands as a time tested price action zone</strong>. Therefore keeping the very first rule of technical analysis in perspective, i.e. <strong>“History tends to repeat itself”</strong> we go with the belief that support and resistance levels will be reasonably honoured.</p>\n<p>Purely from my personal trading experience, well constructed S&amp;R points are usually well respected.</p>\n<h2>11.5 – Optimization and checklist</h2>\n<p>Perhaps, we are now at the most important juncture in this module. We will start discovering a few optimization techniques which will help us identify high-quality trades. Remember, when you seek quality, quantity is always compromised, but this is a compromise that is worth making. The idea is to identify quality trading signals as opposed to identifying plenty but worthless trades.</p>\n<p>Optimization, in general, is a technique wherein you fine-tune a process for best possible results. The process in this context is about identifying trades.</p>\n<p>Let us go back to candlesticks patterns, maybe to the very first we learnt – bullish marubuzo. A bullish marubuzo suggests a long trade near the close of the marubuzo, with the low of the marubuzo acting as the stoploss.</p>\n<p>Assume the following credentials for the bullish marubuzo:</p>\n<p>Open = 432, High = 449, Low = 430, Close = 448</p>\n<p>Hence the entry for the long trade is approximately at 448, with 430 as the stoploss.</p>\n<p>Now, what if the low of the marubuzo also coincides with a good time tested support? Do you see a remarkable confluence of two technical theories here?</p>\n<p>We have a double confirmation to go long. Think about it on the following terms:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A recognized candlestick pattern (bullish marubuzo) suggests the trader initiate a long trade.</li>\n<li>Support near the stoploss price suggests the trader the presence of significant buying interest around the low.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While dealing with a fairly random environment such as the markets, what a trader really needs is a well-crafted trade setup. The occurrence of the above two conditions (marubuzo + support near the low) suggests the same action, i.e. to initiate a long trade in this case.</p>\n<p>This leads us to an important idea. What if we had a checklist (call it a framework if you like) for every trade we consider? The checklist would act as a guiding principle before initiating a trade. The trade should comply with the conditions specified in the checklist. If it does, we take the trade; else we drop it and look for another trade opportunity that complies with the checklist.</p>\n<p>Discipline, they say makes up for the 80% of the trader’s success. In my opinion, the checklist forces you to be disciplined; it helps you avoid taking an abrupt and reckless trading decision.</p>\n<p>In fact, to begin with, we have the first two critical factors of the checklist:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The stock should form a recognizable candlestick pattern.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Note: We have learnt some of the popular patterns in this module. To begin with, you can use just these patterns to comply with the checklist</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>S&amp;R should confirm to the trade. The stoploss price should be around S&amp;R.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>For a long trade, the low of the pattern should be around the support.</li>\n<li>For a short trade, the high of the pattern should be around the resistance.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From now on in this module, as and when we learn new TA concepts, we will build this checklist. But to quench your curiosity, the final checklist will have 6 checklist points. In fact, when we have the grand 6 checklist points, we will weigh down each one of them. For example, checklist point number 4 may not be as important as point number 1, but it is more important than 100 other factors that distract the trader.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>S&amp;R are price points on the chart</li>\n<li>Support is a price point below the current market price that indicate buying interest.</li>\n<li>Resistance is a price point above the current market price that indicate selling interest.</li>\n<li>To identify S&amp;R, place a horizontal line in such a way that it connects at least 3 price action zones, well-spaced in time. The more number of price action zones (well spaced in time) the horizontal line connects, the stronger is S&amp;R</li>\n<li>S&amp;R can be used to identify targets for the trade. For a long trade, look for the immediate resistance level as the target. For a short trade, look for the immediate support level as the target.</li>\n<li>Lastly, comply with the checklist for optimal trading results</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

The more active the share, the higher would be its volume. For example, you decide to buy 100 shares of Amara Raja Batteries at 485, and I decide to sell 100 shares of Amara Raja Batteries at 485. There are a price and quantity match, which results in a trade. You and I together have created a volume of 100 shares. Many people tend to assume volume count as 200 (100 buys + 100 sells), which is not the right way to look at volumes.</p>\n<p>The following fictional example should help you understand how volumes add up on a typical trading day:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Time</th>\n<th>Buy Quantity</th>\n<th>Sell Quantity</th>\n<th>Price</th>\n<th>Volume</th>\n<th>Cumulative Volume</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>9:30 AM</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>62.20</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>10.30 AM</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>62.75</td>\n<td>500</td>\n<td>900</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>11:30 AM</td>\n<td>350</td>\n<td>350</td>\n<td>63.10</td>\n<td>350</td>\n<td>1,250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>12:30 PM</td>\n<td>150</td>\n<td>150</td>\n<td>63.50</td>\n<td>150</td>\n<td>1,400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>1:30 PM</td>\n<td>625</td>\n<td>625</td>\n<td>63.75</td>\n<td>625</td>\n<td>2,025</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td>2:30 PM</td>\n<td>475</td>\n<td>475</td>\n<td>64.20</td>\n<td>475</td>\n<td>2,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td>3:30 PM</td>\n<td>800</td>\n<td>800</td>\n<td>64.50</td>\n<td>800</td>\n<td>3,300</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>At 9:30 AM there were 400 shares exchanged at the price of 62.20. An hour later, 500 shares were traded at 62.75. At 10:30 AM if you were to check the total volume for the day, it would be 900 (400 + 500). Likewise, 350 shares at 63.10 were traded at 11:30 AM, and upto 11:30 AM, the volume was 1,250 (400+500+350). So on, and so forth.</p>\n<p>Here is a screenshot from the live market highlighting the volumes for some of the shares. The screenshot was taken around 2:55 PM on 5<sup>th</sup> of August 2014.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch12-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-786\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"220\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch12-chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch12-chart1.jpg 639w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch12-chart1-300x103.jpg 300w\" width=\"639\"/></strong></p>\n<p>If you notice, the volume on Cummins India Limited is 12,72,737 shares. Likewise, the volume on Naukri (Info Edge India Limited) is 85,427 shares.</p>\n<p>The volume information that you see here is the cumulative volume. Meaning, at 2:55 PM, a total of 12,72,737 shares of Cummins were traded at various price points ranging from 634.90 (low) and 689.85 (high).</p>\n<p>With 35 minutes left for the markets to close, it is only logical to expect the volumes to increase (assuming traders continue to trade the stock for the rest of the day). In fact here is another screenshot taken at 3:30 PM for the same set of stocks with volume highlighted.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch12-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-787\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"239\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch12-chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch12-chart2.jpg 639w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch12-chart2-300x112.jpg 300w\" width=\"639\"/></strong></p>\n<p>As you can see, the volume for Cummins India Limited has increased from 12,72,737 to 13,49,736. Therefore, for Cummins India, the volume for the day is 13,49,736 shares. The volume for Naukri has increased from 85,427 to 86,712, making 86,712 shares as the volume for the day. You need to note that the volumes shown here are cumulative.</p>\n<h2>12.1 – The volume trend table</h2>\n<p>Volume information on its own is quite useless. For example, we know that the volumes on Cummins India are 13,49,736 shares. So how useful is this information when read in isolation? If you think about it, it has no merit and hence would actually mean nothing. However, when you associate today’s volume information with the preceding price and volume trend, volume information becomes more meaningful.</p>\n<p>In the table below, you will find a summary of how to use volume information:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Price</th>\n<th>Volume</th>\n<th>What is the expectation?</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>Increases</td>\n<td>Increases</td>\n<td>Bullish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>Increases</td>\n<td>Decreases</td>\n<td>Caution – weak hands buying</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>Decreases</td>\n<td>Increases</td>\n<td>Bearish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>Decreases</td>\n<td>Decreases</td>\n<td>Caution – weak hands selling</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The first line in the table above says, when the price increases along with an increase in volume, the expectation is bullish.</p>\n<p>Before we understand the table above in detail, think about this – we are talking about an ‘increase in the volume’. What does this actually mean? What is the reference point?  Should it be an increase over the previous day’s volume number or the previous week’s aggregate volume?</p>\n<p>As a practice, traders usually compare today’s volume over the average of the last 10 days volume. Generally, the rule of thumb is as follows:</p>\n<p>High Volume = Today’s volume &gt; last 10 days average volume<br/>\nLow Volume = Today’s volume &lt; last 10 days average volume<br/>\nAverage Volume = Today’s volume = last 10 days average volume</p>\n<p>To get the last 10-day average, all you need to do is draw a moving average line on the volume bars, and the job is done. Of course, we will discuss moving averages in the next chapter.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch12-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-788\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch12-chart3.jpg\" width=\"606\"/></strong></p>\n<p>In the chart above, you can see that volumes are represented by blue bars (at the bottom of the chart). The red line overlaid on the volume bars indicates the 10-day average. As you notice, all the volume bars that are over and above the 10-day average can be considered as the increased volume where some institutional activity (or large participation) has taken place.</p>\n<p>Keeping this in perspective, I would suggest you now look at the volume – price table.</p>\n<h2>12.2 – The thought process behind the volume trend table</h2>\n<p>When institutional investors buy or sell, they obviously do not transact in small chunks. For example, think about India’s LIC; they are one of India’s biggest domestic institutional investors. If they would buy shares of Cummins India, would you think they would buy 500 shares? Obviously not, they would probably buy 500,000 shares or even more. If they were to buy 500,000 shares from the open market, it would start reflecting in volumes. Besides, because they are buying a large chunk of shares, the share price also tends to go up. Usually, institutional money is referred to as “smart money”. It is perceived that ‘smart money’ always makes wiser moves in the market than retail traders. Hence following the smart money seems like a wise idea.</p>\n<p>If both the price and the volume are increasing this only means one thing – a big player is showing interest in the stock. Going by the assumption that smart money always makes smart choices, the expectation turns bullish, and hence one should look at buying opportunity in the stock.</p>\n<p>Or as a corollary, whenever you decide to buy, ensure that the volumes are substantial. This means that you are buying along with the smart money.</p>\n<p>This is exactly what the <strong>1st row</strong> in the volume trend table indicates – expectation turns bullish when both the price and volume increases.</p>\n<p>What do you think happens when the price increases but the volume decreases as indicated in the <strong>2<sup>nd</sup> row</strong>?</p>\n<p>Think about it on the following terms:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why is the price increasing?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Because market participants are buying</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Are there any institutional buyers associated with the price increase?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Not likely</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>How would you know that there is no meaningful purchase by institutional investors?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Simple, if they were buying, then the volumes would have increased and not decrease.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>So what does a price increase, associated by decreasing volumes indicate?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>It means the price is increasing because of small retail participation and not really influential buying. Hence it would help if you were cautious as this could be a possible bull trap.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Going forward, the <strong>3rd row</strong> says, a decrease in price along with an increase in volume sets a bearish expectation. Why do you think so?</p>\n<p>A price decrease indicates that market participants are selling the stock. Increase in volumes indicates the presence of smart money. Both events occurring together (decrease in price + increase in volumes) imply that smart money is selling stocks. Going by the assumption that smart money always makes smart choices, the expectation is bearish, and hence one should look at selling opportunity in the stock.</p>\n<p>Or as a corollary, whenever you decide to sell, ensure that the volumes are good. This means that you too, are selling, along with the smart money.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, what do you think happens when both volume and price decrease as indicated in the <strong>4<sup>th</sup> row</strong>?</p>\n<p>Think about it in on following terms:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why is the price decreasing?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Because market participants are selling.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Are there any institutional sellers associated with the price decrease?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Not likely</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>How would you know that there are no meaningful sell orders by institutional investors?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Simple, if they were selling, then the volume would increase and not decrease.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>So how would you infer a decline in price and a decline in volume?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>It means the price decreases because of small retail participation, and not really influential (read as smart money) selling. Hence it would help if you were cautious as this could be a possible bear trap.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>12.3 – Revisiting the checklist</h2>\n<p>Let us revisit the checklist and evaluate from the perspective of the volume. Imagine this hypothetical technical situation in a stock:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The occurrence of a bullish engulfing pattern – this suggests a long trade for reasons discussed previously</li>\n<li>A support level around the low of bullish engulfing – support indicates demand. Therefore the occurrence of a bullish engulfing pattern near the support area suggests there is indeed a strong demand for the stock, and hence the trader can look at buying the stock.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>With a recognizable candlestick pattern and support near the stoploss, the trader gets a double confirmation to go long.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now along with support near the low, imagine high volumes on the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of the bullish engulfing pattern, i.e. on P2 (blue candle). What can you infer from this?</p>\n<p>The inference is quite clear – high volumes and a price increase confirm that large, influential market participants are positioning themselves to buy the stock.</p>\n<p>With all three independent variables, i.e. candlesticks, S&amp;R, and volumes, suggest taking the same action, i.e. to go long. If you realize this is a triple confirmation!</p>\n<p>I want to drive across the fact that volumes are compelling as it helps the trader confirm a trade. For this reason, it is an important factor and therefore, must be included in the checklist.</p>\n<p>Here is how the updated checklist now stands:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The stock should form a recognizable candlestick pattern</li>\n<li>S&amp;R should confirm the trade. The stoploss price should be around S&amp;R\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>For a long trade, the low of the pattern should be around the support</li>\n<li>For a short trade, the high of the pattern should be around the resistance</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Volumes should confirm to the trade\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Presence of above average volumes on both buy and sell day</li>\n<li>Low volumes are not encouraging and hence do feel free to hesitate to take a trade where the volumes are low</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from the chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Volumes are used to confirm a trend</li>\n<li>100 share buy and 100 shares sell the total volume 100, not 200</li>\n<li>The end of day volumes indicates the cumulative volume across trades executed throughout the day</li>\n<li>High volumes indicate the presence of smart money</li>\n<li>Low volumes indicate retail participation</li>\n<li>When you initiate a trade to either go long or short always make sure if volumes confirm</li>\n<li>Avoid trading on low volume days</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

The sun is so bright and nice that each one of them ends up drinking several bottles of the beverage. Assume the final count to be something like this:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Person</th>\n<th>No of Bottles</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">01</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">A</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">07</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">02</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">B</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">05</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">03</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">C</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">06</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">04</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">D</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">03</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">05</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">E</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">08</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"2\">Total # of bottles consumed</th>\n<th>29</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Assume a 6<sup>th</sup> person walks in to find out 29 bottles of beverages lying around them. He can quickly get a sense of ‘roughly’ how many bottles each of them consumed by dividing <strong>[the total number of bottles]</strong>  by <strong>[total number of people]</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this case, it would be:</p>\n<p>=29/5<br/>\n=5.8 bottles per head.</p>\n<p>So, the average, in this case, tells us roughly how many bottles each person had consumed. Obviously, there would be few of them who had consumed above and below the average. For example, Person E drank 8 bottles of beverage, which is way above the average of 5.8 bottles. Likewise, person D drank just 3 bottles of beverage, which is way below the average of 5.8 bottles. Therefore the average is just an estimate, and one cannot expect it to be accurate.</p>\n<p>Extending the concept to stocks, here are the closing prices of ITC Limited for the last 5 trading sessions. The last 5-day average close would be calculated as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Closing Price</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14/07/14</td>\n<td>344.95</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15/07/14</td>\n<td>342.35</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16/07/14</td>\n<td>344.20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17/07/14</td>\n<td>344.25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18/07/14</td>\n<td>344.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Total</th>\n<th>1719.75</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>= 1719.75 / 5<br/>\n= 343.95</p>\n<p>Hence the average closing price of ITC over the last 5 trading sessions is 343.95.</p>\n<h2>13.1 – The ‘moving’ average (also called the simple moving average)</h2>\n<p>Consider a situation where you want to calculate the average closing price of Marico Limited for the <strong>latest</strong> <strong>5 days</strong>. The data is as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Closing Price</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21/07/14</td>\n<td>239.2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22/07/14</td>\n<td>240.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23/07/14</td>\n<td>241.8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24/07/14</td>\n<td>242.8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25/07/14</td>\n<td>247.9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Total</th>\n<th>1212.3</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>= 1212.3/ 5<br/>\n= 242.5</p>\n<p>Hence the average closing price of Marico over the last 5 trading sessions is 242.5</p>\n<p>Moving forward, the next day, i.e. 28<sup>th</sup> July (26<sup>th</sup> and 27<sup>th</sup> were Saturday and Sunday respectively) we have a new data point. This implies now the ‘new’ latest 5 days would be 22<sup>nd</sup>, 23<sup>rd</sup>, 24<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup>. We will drop the data point belonging to the 21st as our objective is to calculate the latest 5-day average.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Closing Price</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22/07/14</td>\n<td>240.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23/07/14</td>\n<td>241.8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24/07/14</td>\n<td>242.8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25/07/14</td>\n<td>247.9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>28/07/14</td>\n<td>250.2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Total</th>\n<th>1223.3</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>= 1223.3/ 5<br/>\n= 244.66</p>\n<p>Hence the average closing price of Marico over the last 5 trading sessions is 244.66</p>\n<p>As you can see, we have included the latest data (28<sup>th</sup> July) and discarded the oldest data (21<sup>st</sup> July) to calculate the 5-day average.  On 29<sup>th</sup>, we would include 29<sup>th</sup> data and exclude 22<sup>nd</sup> data, on 30<sup>th,</sup> we would include 30<sup>th</sup> data point but eliminate 23<sup>rd</sup> data, so on.</p>\n<p>We are essentially moving to the latest data point and discarding the oldest to calculate the latest 5-day average. Hence the name “moving” average!</p>\n<p>In the above example, the calculation of the moving average is based on the closing prices.  Sometimes, moving averages are also calculated using other parameters such as high, low, and open. However, the closing prices are used mostly by the traders and investors as it reflects the price at which the market finally settles down.</p>\n<p>Moving averages can be calculated for any time frame, from minutes, hours to years.  Any time frame can be selected from the charting software-based of your requirements.</p>\n<p>For those of you familiar with excel, here is a screenshot of how moving averages are calculated on MS Excel. Notice how the cell reference moves in the average formula, eliminating the oldest to include the latest data points.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Cell Ref</th>\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Close Price</th>\n<th>5 Day Average</th>\n<th>Average Formula</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D3</td>\n<td>1-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1287.7</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D4</td>\n<td>2-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1279.25</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D5</td>\n<td>3-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1258.95</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D6</td>\n<td>6-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1249.7</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D7</td>\n<td>7-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1242.4</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D8</td>\n<td>8-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1268.75</td>\n<td>1263.6</td>\n<td>=AVERAGE(D3:D7)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D9</td>\n<td>9-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1231.2</td>\n<td>1259.81</td>\n<td>=AVERAGE(D4:D8)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D10</td>\n<td>10-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1201.75</td>\n<td>1250.2</td>\n<td>=AVERAGE(D5:D9)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D11</td>\n<td>13-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1159.2</td>\n<td>1238.76</td>\n<td>=AVERAGE(D6:D10)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D12</td>\n<td>14-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1157.25</td>\n<td>1220.66</td>\n<td>=AVERAGE(D7:D11)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D13</td>\n<td>15-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1141.35</td>\n<td>1203.63</td>\n<td>=AVERAGE(D8:D12)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D14</td>\n<td>16-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1152.5</td>\n<td>1178.15</td>\n<td>=AVERAGE(D9:D13)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D15</td>\n<td>17-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1139.6</td>\n<td>1162.41</td>\n<td>=AVERAGE(D10:D14)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D16</td>\n<td>20-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1140.6</td>\n<td>1149.98</td>\n<td>=AVERAGE(D11:D15)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D17</td>\n<td>21-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1166.35</td>\n<td>1146.26</td>\n<td>=AVERAGE(D12:D16)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D18</td>\n<td>22-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1165.4</td>\n<td>1148.08</td>\n<td>=AVERAGE(D13:D17)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D19</td>\n<td>23-Jan-14</td>\n<td>1168.25</td>\n<td>1152.89</td>\n<td>=AVERAGE(D14:D18)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As it is evident, the moving average changes as and when the closing price changes. As calculated above, a moving average is called a ‘Simple Moving Average’ (SMA). Since we are calculating it as per the latest 5 days of data, it is called referred to as 5 Day SMA.</p>\n<p>The averages for the 5 days (or it could be anything like 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 days) are then joined to form a smooth curving line known as the moving average line, and it continues to move as the time progresses.</p>\n<p>In the chart shown below, I have overlaid a 5 day SMA over ACC’s candlestick graph.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch13-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-798\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart1.jpg\" width=\"639\"/></strong></p>\n<p>So what does a moving average indicator, and how does one use it?  There are many moving average applications, and shortly I will introduce a simple trading system based on moving averages. But before that, let us learn about the Exponential Moving Average.</p>\n<h2>13.2 – The exponential moving average</h2>\n<p>Consider the data points used in this example,</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Date</th>\n<th>Closing Price</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22/07/14</td>\n<td>240.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23/07/14</td>\n<td>241.8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24/07/14</td>\n<td>242.8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25/07/14</td>\n<td>247.9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>28/07/14</td>\n<td>250.2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Total</th>\n<th>1214.5</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>When one calculates the average across these numbers, there is an unstated assumption. We are essentially giving each data point equal importance. We are assuming that the data point on 22<sup>nd</sup> July is as important as the data point on 28<sup>th</sup> July. However, when it comes to markets, this may not always be true</p>\n<p>Remember the basic assumption of technical analysis – markets discount everything. This means the latest price you see (on 28<sup>th</sup> July) discounts all the known and unknown information. This also implies the price on 28<sup>th</sup> is more sacred than the price on 25<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n<p>One would like to assign weightage to data points based on the ‘newness’ of the data. Therefore the data point on 28<sup>th</sup> July gets the highest weightage, 25<sup>th</sup> July gets the next highest weightage, 24<sup>th</sup> July gets the 3<sup>rd</sup> highest, and so on.</p>\n<p>By doing so, I have essentially scaled the data points according to its newness – the latest data point gets the maximum attention, and the oldest data point gets the least attention.</p>\n<p>The average calculated on this scaled set of numbers gives us the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). I deliberately skipped the EMA calculation part, simply because most of the technical analysis software lets us drag and drop the EMA on prices. Hence we will focus on EMA’s application as opposed to its calculation.</p>\n<p>Here is a chart of Cipla Ltd. I have plotted a 50 day SMA (black) and a 50 day EMA (red) on Cipla’s closing prices. Though both SMA and EMA are for a 50 day period, you can notice that the EMA is more reactive to the prices and sticks closer to the price.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch13-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-799\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"241\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart2.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p>EMA is quicker to react to the current market price because EMA gives more importance to the most recent data points. This helps the trader to take quicker trading decisions. Hence, for this reason, traders prefer the use of the EMA over the SMA.</p>\n<h2>13.3 – A simple application of moving average</h2>\n<p>The moving average can be used to identify buying and selling opportunities with its own merit. When the stock price trades above its average price, it means the traders are willing to buy the stock at a price higher than its average price. This means the traders are optimistic about the stock price going higher. Therefore one should look at buying opportunities.</p>\n<p>Likewise, when the stock price trades below its average price, it means the traders are willing to sell the stock at a price lesser than its average price. This means the traders are pessimistic about the stock price movement. Therefore one should look at selling opportunities.</p>\n<p>We can develop a simple trading system based on these conclusions. A trading system can be defined as a set of rules that help you identify entry and exit points.</p>\n<p>We will now try and define one such trading system based on a 50-day exponential moving average. Remember a good trading system gives you a signal to enter a trade and a signal to close out the trade.  We can define the moving average trading system with the following rules:</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 1)</strong> Buy (go long) when the current market price turns greater than the 50 days EMA. Once you go long, you should stay invested till the necessary sell condition is satisfied.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 2)</strong> Exit the long position (square off) when the current market price turns lesser than the 50 days EMA.</p>\n<p>Here is a chart that shows the application of the trading system on Ambuja cement. The black line on the price chart is the 50-day exponential moving average.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch13-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-800\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"353\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart3.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p>Starting from left, the first opportunity to buy originated at 165, highlighted on the charts as B1@165. Notice, at point B1, the stock price moved to a point higher than its 50 days EMA. Hence as per the trading system rule, we initiate a fresh long position.</p>\n<p>We stay invested by the trading system till we get an exit signal, which we eventually got at 187, marked as S1@187. This trade generated a profit of Rs.22 per share.</p>\n<p>The next signal to go long came at B2@178, followed by a signal to square off at S2@182. This trade was not as impressive as it resulted in a profit of just Rs.4. However, the last trade, B3@165, and S3@215 were quite impressive, resulting in a profit of Rs.50.</p>\n<p>Here is a quick summary of these trades based on the trading system fared:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Buy Price</th>\n<th>Sell Price</th>\n<th>Gain/Loss</th>\n<th>% Return</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>165</td>\n<td>187</td>\n<td>22</td>\n<td>13%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>178</td>\n<td>182</td>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>2.2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>165</td>\n<td>215</td>\n<td>50</td>\n<td>30%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>From the above table, it is obvious that the first and last trades were profitable, but the 2<sup>nd</sup> trade was not so profitable. If you inspect why this happened, it is evident that the stock was trending during the 1<sup>st</sup> and the 3<sup>rd</sup> trade, but during the 2<sup>nd</sup> trade, the stock moved sideways.</p>\n<p>This leads us to a significant conclusion about the moving averages. Moving averages works brilliantly when there is a trend and fails to perform when the stock moves sideways. This basically means the ‘Moving average’ in its simplest form is a trend following system.</p>\n<p>From my own personal experience of trading based on moving averages, I have noticed a few important characteristics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Moving averages gives you many trading signals (buy and sell) during a sideways market. Most of these signals result in marginal profits, if not for losses</li>\n<li>However usually one of those many trades results in a massive rally (like the B3@165 trade) leading to impressive gains</li>\n<li>It would be tough to segregate the big winner from the many small trades</li>\n<li>Hence the trader should not be selective in terms of selecting signals that moving average system suggest. In fact, the trader should trade all the trades that the system suggests</li>\n<li>Remember the losses are minimized in a moving average system, but that 1 big trade is good enough to compensate for all the losses and can give you sufficient profits</li>\n<li>The profit-making trade ensures you are in the trend as long as the trend lasts. Sometimes even upto several months. For this reason, MA can be used as a proxy for identifying long term investment ideas</li>\n<li>The key to MA trading system is to take all the trades and not be judgmental about the signals being generated by the system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is another example of BPCL, where the MA system suggested multiple trades during the sideways market; however, none of them was really profitable. However, the last trade resulted in a 67% profit in about 5 months.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch13-chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-801\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"228\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart4.jpg 1321w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart4-300x110.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart4-1024x376.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<h2>13.4 – Moving average crossover system</h2>\n<p>As its evident now the problem with the plain vanilla moving average system is that it generates far too many trading signals in a sideways market. A moving average crossover system is an improvisation over the plain vanilla moving average system. It helps the trader to take fewer trades in a sideways market.</p>\n<p>Instead of the usual single moving average in a MA crossover system, the trader combines two moving averages. This is usually referred to as ‘smoothing’.</p>\n<p>A typical example of this would be to combine a 50 day EMA, with a 100 day EMA. The shorter moving average (50 days in this case) is also referred to as the faster-moving average. The longer moving average (100 days moving average) is referred to as the slower moving average.</p>\n<p>The shorter moving average takes a lesser number of data points to calculate the average, and hence it tends to stick closer to the current market price and therefore reacts more quickly. A longer moving average takes more data points to calculate the average, and hence it tends to stay away from the current market price. Hence the reactions are slower.</p>\n<p>Here is the Bank of Baroda chart, showing you how the two moving averages stack up when loaded on a chart.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch13-chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-802\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"229\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart5.jpg 1322w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart5-300x110.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart5-1024x376.jpg 1024w\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p>As you can see, the black 50 day EMA line is closer to the current market price (as it reacts faster) compared to the pink 100 days EMA (as it reacts slower).</p>\n<p>Traders have modified the plain vanilla MA system with the crossover system to smoothen out the entry and exit points. The trader gets far fewer signals in the process, but the chances of the trade being profitable are quite high.</p>\n<p>The entry and exit rules for the crossover system is as stated below:</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 1)</strong> – Buy (fresh long) when the short term moving averages turns greater than the long term moving average. Stay in the trade as long as this condition is satisfied</p>\n<p><strong>Rule 2)</strong> – Exit the long position (square off) when the short term moving average turns lesser than the longer-term moving average</p>\n<p>Let us apply the MA crossover system to the same BPCL example that we looked at. For ease of comparison, I have reproduced the BPCL’s chart with a single 50 day MA.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch13-chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-803\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"228\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart6.jpg 624w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart6-300x110.jpg 300w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>Notice, when the markets were moving sideways, MA suggested at least 3 trading signals. However, the 4<sup>th</sup> trade was the winner which resulted in 67% profit.</p>\n<p>The chart shown below shows the application of a MA crossover system with 50 and 100 days EMA.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch13-chart7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-804\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"222\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart7.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>The black line plots the 50-day moving average and the pink line plots the 100-day moving average. As per the cross overrule, the signal to go long originates when the 50-day moving average (short term MA) crosses over the 100-day moving average (long term MA). The crossover point has been highlighted with an arrow. Please do notice how the crossover system keeps the trader away from the 3 unprofitable trades. This is the biggest advantage of a cross over system.</p>\n<p>A trader can use any combination to create a MA cross over system. Some of the popular combinations for a swing trader would be:</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>9 day EMA with 21 days EMA – use this for short term trades ( upto few trading session)</li>\n<li>25 day EMA with 50 days EMA – use this to identify medium-term trade (upto few weeks)</li>\n<li>50 day EMA with 100 Day EMA – use this to identify trades that lasts upto few months</li>\n<li>100 day EMA with 200 days EMA – use this to identify long term trades (investment opportunities), some of them can even last for over a year or more.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember, longer the time frame, the lesser the number of trading signals.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a 25 x 50 EMA crossover. Three trading signals qualify under the crossover rule.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch13-chart8\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-805\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"228\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart8.jpg 1327w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart8-300x110.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch13-chart8-1024x374.jpg 1024w\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p>Needless to say, the MA crossover system can also be applied for intraday trading. For instance, one could use the 15 x 30 minutes crossover to identify intraday opportunities. A more aggressive trader could use a 5 x 10-minute crossover.</p>\n<p>You may have heard this popular saying in the markets – “The trend is your, friend”. Well, the moving averages help you identify this friend.</p>\n<p>Remember, MA is a trend following system – as long as there is a trend, the moving averages work brilliantly. It does not matter which time frame you use or which cross over combination you use.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A standard average calculation is a quick approximation of a series of numbers</li>\n<li>In an average calculation where the latest data is included, and the oldest is excluded called a Moving Average</li>\n<li>The simple moving average (SMA) gives equal weightage to all data points in the series</li>\n<li>An exponential moving average (EMA) scales the data according to its newness.

These lines are called the ‘Technical Indicators’. A technical indicator helps a trader analyze the price movement of a security.</p>\n<p>Indicators are independent trading systems introduced to the world by successful traders. Indicators are built on preset logic using which traders can supplement their technical study (candlesticks, volumes, S&amp;R) to arrive at a trading decision. Indicators help in buying, selling, confirming trends, and sometimes predicting trends.</p>\n<p>Indicators are of two types, namely leading and lagging.  A leading indicator leads the price, meaning it usually signals the occurrence of a reversal or a new trend in advance. While this sounds interesting, you should note, not all leading indicators are accurate. Leading indicators are notorious for giving false signals. Therefore, the trader should be highly alert while using leading indicators. In fact, the efficiency of using leading indicators increases with trading experience.</p>\n<p>A majority of leading indicators are called oscillators as they oscillate within a bounded range. Typically an oscillator oscillates between two extreme values – for example, 0 to 100. Based on the oscillator’s reading (for example 55, 70 etc.) the trading interpretation varies.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a lagging indicator lags the price; meaning it usually signals the occurrence of a reversal or a new trend after it has occurred.  You may think, what would be the use of getting a signal after the event has occurred? Well, it is better late than never. One of the most popular lagging indicators is the moving averages.</p>\n<p>You might be wondering if the moving average is an indicator in itself, why we discussed it even before we discussed the indicators formally. The reason is that moving averages is a core concept on its own. It finds its application within several indicators such as RSI, MACD, Stochastic etc. Hence, for this reason, we discussed moving average as a standalone topic.</p>\n<p>Before we further understand individual indicators, I think it is a good idea to understand what momentum means. Momentum is the rate at which the price changes. For example, if the stock price is Rs.100 today and it moves to Rs.105 the next day, and Rs.115, the day after, we say the momentum is high as the stock price has changed by 15% in just 3 days. However, if the same 15% change happened over to let us say 3 months, we can conclude the momentum is low. So the more rapidly the price changes, the higher the momentum.</p>\n<h2>14.1 – Relative Strength Index</h2>\n<p>Relative strength Index or just RSI, is a prevalent indicator developed by J.Welles Wilder. RSI is a leading momentum indicator which helps in identifying a trend reversal. RSI indicator oscillates between 0 and 100 and based on the latest indicator reading, the expectations on the markets are set.</p>\n<p>The term “Relative Strength Index” can be a bit misleading as it does not compare the relative strength of two securities, but instead shows the internal strength of the security. RSI is the most popular leading indicator, which gives out the strongest signals during the periods of sideways and non-trending ranges.</p>\n<p>The formula to calculate the RSI is as follows:</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch14-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-820 size-medium\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"133\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch14-Chart1-300x133.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch14-Chart1-300x133.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch14-Chart1.jpg 815w\" width=\"300\"/></strong></p>\n<p>Let us understand this indicator with the help of the following example:</p>\n<p>Assume the stock is trading at 99 on day 0, with this in perspective; consider the following data points:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Closing Price</th>\n<th>Points Gain</th>\n<th>Points Lost</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>102</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>105</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>107</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>103</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td>99</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td>97</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>105</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>107</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>110</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>114</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>118</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"2\">Total</th>\n<th>29</th>\n<th>10</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>In the above table, points gained/lost denote the number of points gained/lost concerning the previous day close. For example, if today’s close is 104 and yesterday’s close was 100, points gained would be 4 and points lost would be 0. Similarly, if today’s close was 104 and the previous day’s close was 107, the points gained would be 0 and points lost would be 3. Please note that the loses are computed as positive values.</p>\n<p>We have used 14 data points for the calculation, the default period setting in the charting software. This is also called the ‘look-back period’. If you are analyzing hourly charts, the default period is 14 hours, and if you are analyzing daily charts, the default period is 14 days.</p>\n<p>The first step is to calculate ‘RS’ also called the RSI factor. As you can see in the formula, RS is the ratio of average points gained by the average points lost.</p>\n<p>Average Points Gained = 29/14</p>\n<p>= 2.07</p>\n<p>Average Points Lost = 10/14</p>\n<p>= 0.714</p>\n<p>RS = 2.07/0.714</p>\n<p>= 2.8991</p>\n<p>Plugging in the value of RS in RSI formula,</p>\n<p>= 100 – [100/ (1+2.8991)]</p>\n<p>= 100 – [100/3.8991]</p>\n<p>= 100 – 25.6469</p>\n<p><strong>RSI = 74.3531</strong></p>\n<p>As you can see, the RSI calculation is fairly simple. The objective of using RSI is to help the trader identify oversold and overbought price areas. Overbought implies that the stock’s positive momentum is so high that it may not be sustainable for long, and hence there could be a correction. Likewise, an oversold position indicates that the negative momentum is high, leading to a possible reversal.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the chart of Cipla Ltd; you will find a lot of interesting developments:</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch14-Chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-813\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"249\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch14-Chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch14-Chart2.jpg 1325w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch14-Chart2-300x120.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch14-Chart2-1024x408.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>To begin with, the red line below the price chart indicates the 14 periods RSI. If you notice the RSI’s scale, you will realize it’s upper bound to 100, and lower bound to 0. However, 100 and 0 are not visible in the chart.</p>\n<p>When the RSI reading is between 30 and 0, the security is supposed to be oversold and ready for an upward correction. When the security reading is between 70 and 100, the security is supposed to be heavily bought and is ready for a downward correction.</p>\n<p>The first vertical line marked from left shows a level where RSI is below 30; in fact, RSI is 26.8. Hence RSI suggests that the stock is oversold. In this particular example, the RSI value of 26.8, also coincides with a bullish engulfing pattern. This gives the trader a double confirmation to go long! Needless to say, both volumes and S&amp;R should also conform to this.</p>\n<p>The second vertical line points to a level where the RSI turns 81, a value which is considered overbought. Hence, if not for looking at shorting opportunities, the trader should be careful in his decision to buy the stock. Again, if you notice the candles, they form a bearish engulfing pattern. A bearish engulfing pattern, backed by an RSI of 81 is a sign to short the stock. What follows this is a quick and a short correction in the stock.</p>\n<p>The example that I have shown here is quite nice, meaning both the candlestick pattern and RSI perfectly align to confirm the same event’s occurrence. This may not always be true. This leads us to another interesting way to interpret RSI. Imagine the following two scenarios:</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1)</strong> A stock which is in a continuous uptrend (remember the uptrend can last from few days to few years) the RSI will remain stuck in the overbought region for a long time, and this is because the RSI is upper bound to 100. It cannot go beyond 100. Invariably the trader would be looking at shorting opportunities, but the stock, on the other hand, will be in a different orbit. Example – Eicher Motors Limited, the stock has generated a return of close to 100% year on year.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2) </strong>A stock that is in a continuous downtrend, the RSI will be stuck in the oversold region since it is lower bound to 0. It cannot go beyond 0. In this case, the trader will be looking at buying opportunities, but the stock will be going down lower. Example – Suzlon Energy, the stock has generated a return of negative 34% year on year.</p>\n<p>This leads us to interpret RSI in many different ways besides the classical interpretation (which we discussed earlier)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the RSI is fixed in an overbought region for a prolonged period, look for buying opportunities instead of shorting. The RSI stays in the overbought region for a prolonged period because of an excess positive momentum.</li>\n<li>If the RSI is fixed in an oversold region for a prolonged period, look for selling opportunities rather than buying. RSI stays in the oversold region for a prolonged period because of an excess negative momentum</li>\n<li>If the RSI value starts moving away from the oversold value after a prolonged period, look for buying opportunities. For example, the RSI moves above 30 after a long time may mean that the stock may have bottomed out, hence a case of going long.</li>\n<li>If the RSI value starts moving away from the overbought value after a prolonged period, look for selling opportunities. For example, RSI moving below 70 after a long time. This means the stock may have topped out, hence a case for shorting.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>14.2 – One last note</h2>\n<p>None of the parameters used while analyzing RSI should be treated with rigidity. For example, J.Welles Wilder opted to use a lookback period of 14 days simply because that was the value which gave the best results considering the market conditions in 1978 (which is when RSI was introduced to the world). You may choose to use 5,10,20, or even 100 days look back period if you wish too. In fact, this is how you develop your edge as a trader. You need to analyze what works for you and adopt the same. Please note, the fewer the days you use to calculate the RSI, the more volatile the indicator would be.</p>\n<p>Also, J.Welles Wilder decided to use 0-30 to indicate oversold regions and 70-100 level to indicate the overbought region. Again this is not set in stone; you can arrive at your own combination.</p>\n<p>I personally prefer to use 0-20 level and 80-100 to identify oversold and overbought regions respectively. I use this along with the classical 14 days look back period.</p>\n<p>Of course, I urge you to explore the parameters that work for you. In fact, this is how you would eventually develop as a successful trader.</p>\n<p>Finally, do remember RSI is not used often as a standalone indicator by traders; it is used along with other candlestick patterns and indicators to study the market.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Indicators are independent trading systems developed and introduced by successful traders.</li>\n<li>Indicators are leading or lagging.

Traders consider MACD as the grand old daddy of indicators. Though invented in the seventies, MACD is still considered one of the most reliable momentum traders’ indicators.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, MACD is all about the convergence and divergence of the two moving averages. Convergence occurs when the two moving averages move towards each other, and divergence occurs when the moving averages move away.</p>\n<p>A standard MACD is calculated using a 12 day EMA and a 26 day EMA. Please note, both the EMA’s are based on the closing prices. We subtract the 26 EMA from the 12 day EMA, to estimate the convergence and divergence (CD) value.

the MACD value, let’s try and find the answer for a few obvious questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What does a negative MACD value indicate?</li>\n<li>What does a positive MACD value indicate?</li>\n<li>What does the magnitude of the MACD value actually mean? As in, what information does a -90 MACD  convey versus a – 30 MACD?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The sign associated with the MACD just indicates the direction of the stock’s move. For example, if the 12 Day EMA is 6380, and 26 Day EMA is 6220, the MACD value is +160. Under what circumstance do you think the 12 day EMA will be greater than the 26 day EMA? Well, we had looked into this in the moving average chapter. The shorter-term average will generally be higher than the long term only when the stock price trends upward. Remember, the shorter-term average will always be more reactive to the current market price than the long term average. A positive sign tells us that there is positive momentum in the stock, and the stock is drifting upwards. The higher the momentum, the higher is the magnitude. For example, +160 indicate a positive trend which is stronger than +120.</p>\n<p>However, while dealing with the magnitude, always remember the price of the stock influences the magnitude. For example, the higher the underlying price such as Bank Nifty, naturally, the higher will be the magnitude of the MACD.</p>\n<p>When the MACD is negative, it means the 12 day EMA is lower than the 26 day EMA. Therefore the momentum is negative. Higher the magnitude of the MACD, the more strength in the downward trend.</p>\n<p>The difference between the two moving averages is called the MACD spread. The spread decreases when the momentum mellows down and increases when the momentum increases. To visualize convergence and the divergence traders usually plot the MACD value chart, often referred to as the MACD line.</p>\n<p>The following is the MACD line chart of Nifty for data points starting from 1<sup>st</sup> Jan 2014 to 18<sup>th</sup> Aug 2014.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch15-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-823\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"242\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch15-Chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch15-Chart1.jpg 572w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch15-Chart1-300x127.jpg 300w\" width=\"572\"/></strong></p>\n<p>As you can see, the MACD line oscillates over a central zero line. This is also called the ‘Centerline’. The basic interpretation of the MACD indicator is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When the MACD Line crosses the centerline from the negative territory to positive territory, it means there is a divergence between the two averages. This is a sign of increasing bullish momentum; therefore, one should look at buying opportunities. From the chart above, we can see this panning out around 27<sup>th</sup> Feb</li>\n<li>When the MACD line crosses the centerline from positive territory to the negative territory, it means there is a convergence between the two averages. This is a sign of increasing bearish momentum; therefore, one should look at selling opportunities. As you can see, there were two instances during which the MACD almost turned negative (8<sup>th</sup> May, and 24<sup>th</sup> July) but the MACD just stopped at the zero lines and reversed directions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Traders generally argue that while waiting for the MACD line to crossover the centerline, a bulk of the movie would already be done and perhaps it would be late to enter a trade.  To overcome this, there is an improvisation over this basic MACD line. The improvisation comes in the form of an additional MACD component which is the 9-day signal line. A 9-day signal line is an exponential moving average (EMA) of the MACD line. If you think about this, we now have two lines:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A MACD line</li>\n<li>A 9 day EMA of the MACD line also called the signal line.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A trader can follow a simple 2 line crossover strategy with these two lines as discussed in the moving averages chapter and no longer wait for the centerline cross over.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The sentiment is bullish when the  MACD line crosses the 9 day EMA wherein MACD line is greater than the 9 days EMA. When this happens, the trader should look at buying opportunities.</li>\n<li>The sentiment is bearish when the MACD line crosses below the 9 day EMA wherein the MACD line is lesser than the 9 day EMA. When this happens, the trader should look at selling opportunities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The chart below plots the MACD indicator on Asian Paints Limited. You can see the MACD indicator below the price chart.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch15-Chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-824\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"248\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch15-Chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch15-Chart2.jpg 1332w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch15-Chart2-300x119.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch15-Chart2-1024x407.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>The indicator uses standard parameters of MACD:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>12 day EMA of closing prices</li>\n<li>26 day EMA of closing prices</li>\n<li>MACD line (12D EMA – 26D EMA) represented by the black line</li>\n<li>9 day EMA of the MACD line represented by the red line</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The chart’s vertical lines highlight the chart’s crossover points where a signal to buy or sell originated.</p>\n<p>For example, the first vertical line starting from left points to a crossover where the MACD line lies below the signal line (9 day EMA) lies and suggests a short trade.</p>\n<p>The 2<sup>nd</sup> vertical line from left points to a crossover where the MACD line lies above the signal line should look at buying opportunity. So on and so forth.</p>\n<p>Please note, at the core of the MACD system, are moving averages. Hence the MACD indicator has similar properties like that of a moving average system. They work quite well when there is a strong trend and are not too useful when moving sideways. You can notice this between the 1st two-line starting from left.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the MACD parameters are not set in stone. One is free to change the 12 days, and 26 day EMA to whatever time frame one prefers. I personally like to use the MACD in its original form, as introduced by Gerald Appel.</p>\n<h2>15.2 – The Bollinger Bands</h2>\n<p>Introduced by John Bollinger in the 1980s, Bollinger Bands (BB) is perhaps one of the most useful technical analysis indicators. BB is used to determine overbought and oversold levels, where a trader will try to sell when the price reaches the top of the band and will execute a buy when the price reaches the bottom of the band.</p>\n<p>The BB has 3 components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The middle line which is The 20 day simple moving average of the closing prices</li>\n<li>An upper band – this is the +2 standard deviation of the middle line</li>\n<li>A lower band – this is the -2 standard deviation of the middle line</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The standard deviation (SD) is a statistical concept; which measures a particular variable’s variance from its average. In finance, the standard deviation of the stock price represents the volatility of a stock. For example, if the standard deviation is 12%, it is as good as saying that the stock’s volatility is 12%.</p>\n<p>In BB, the standard deviation is applied on the 20 days SMA. The upper band indicates the +2 SD. Using a +2 SD, we multiply the SD by 2 and add it to the average.</p>\n<p>For example if the 20 day SMA is 7800, and the SD is 75 (or 0.96%), then the +2 SD would be 7800 + (75*2) = 7950. Likewise, a -2 SD indicates we multiply the SD by 2 and subtract it from the average. 7800 – (2*75) = 7650.</p>\n<p>We now have the components of the BB:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>20 day SMA = 7800</li>\n<li>Upper band = 7950</li>\n<li>Lower band = 7650</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Statistically speaking, the current market price should hover around the average price of 7800. However, if the current market price is around 7950, it is considered expensive concerning the average. Hence one should look at shorting opportunities with an expectation that the price will scale back to its average price.</p>\n<p>Therefore the trade would be to sell at 7950, with a target of 7800.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if the current market price is around 7650, it is considered cheap concerning the average prices. Hence, one should consider buying opportunities to expect that the prices will scale back to its average price.</p>\n<p>Therefore the trade would be to buy at 7650, with a target of 7800.</p>\n<p>The upper and lower bands act as a trigger to initiate a trade.</p>\n<p>The following is the chart of BPCL Limited,</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch15-Chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-825\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"229\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch15-Chart3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch15-Chart3.jpg 1321w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch15-Chart3-300x110.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch15-Chart3-1024x376.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>The central black line is the 20 day SMA. The two red lines placed above and below the black like are the +2 SD and -2SD. The idea is to short the stock when the price touches the upper band, expecting it to revert to average. Likewise, one can go long when the price touches the lower band, expecting it to revert to the average.</p>\n<p>I have highlighted using a down arrow all the sell signals BB generated, while most of the signals worked quite well, there was a phase when the price stuck to the upper band. In fact, the price continued to drift higher, and therefore even the upper band expanded. This is called an envelope expansion.</p>\n<p>The BB’s upper and lower band together forms an envelope. The envelope expands, whenever the price drifts in a particular direction, indicating strong momentum. The BB signal fails when there is an envelope expansion. This leads us to an important conclusion; BB works well in sideways markets and fails in a trending market.</p>\n<p>Whenever I use BB, I expect the trade to start working in my favour almost immediately. If it does not, I start validating the possibility of an envelope expansion.</p>\n<h2>15.3 – Other Indicators</h2>\n<p>There are numerous other technical indicators, and the list is endless. The question is, should you know all these indicators to be a successful trader? The answer is a simple no. Technical indicators are good to know, but they by no means should be your main tool of analysis.</p>\n<p>I have personally met many aspiring traders who spend a lot of time and energy learning different indicators, but this is futile in the long run. The working knowledge of a few basic indicators, such as those discussed in this module is sufficient.</p>\n<h2>15.4 – The Checklist</h2>\n<p>In the previous chapters, we started building a checklist that acts as a guiding force behind the trader’s decision to buy or sell. It is time to revisit that checklist.</p>\n<p>The indicators act as a tool which the traders can use to confirm their trading decisions, and it is worthwhile to check what the indicators are conveying before placing a buy or a sell order. While the dependence on indicators is not as much S&amp;R, volumes or candlestick patterns, it is always good to know what the basic indicators suggest. For this reason, I would recommend adding indicators in the checklist, but with a twist to it. I will explain the twist in a bit, but before that, let us reproduce the updated checklist.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The stock should form a recognizable candlestick pattern</li>\n<li>S&amp;R should confirm to the trade.

To fully understand and appreciate the concept of Fibonacci retracements, one must understand the Fibonacci series. The origins of the Fibonacci series can be traced back to the ancient Indian mathematic scripts, with some claims dating back to 200 BC. However, in the 12<sup>th</sup> century, Leonardo Pisano Bogollo, an Italian mathematician from Pisa, known to his friends as Fibonacci discovered Fibonacci numbers.</p>\n<p>The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers starting from zero arranged so that the value of any number in the series is the sum of the previous two numbers.</p>\n<p>The Fibonacci sequence is as follows:</p>\n<p>0 , 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,  55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610…</p>\n<p>Notice the following:<br/>\n233 = 144 + 89<br/>\n144 = 89 + 55<br/>\n89 = 55 +34</p>\n<p>Needless to say, the series extends to infinity. There are few interesting properties of the Fibonacci series.</p>\n<p>Divide any number in the series by the previous number; the ratio is always approximately 1.618.</p>\n<p>For example:<br/>\n610/377 = 1.618<br/>\n377/233 = 1.618<br/>\n233/144 = 1.618</p>\n<p>The ratio of 1.618 is considered as the Golden Ratio, also referred to as the Phi. Fibonacci numbers have their connection to nature. The ratio can be found in the human face, flower petals, animal bodies, fruits, vegetables, rock formation, galaxy formations etc. Of course, let us not get into this discussion as we would be digressing from the main topic.  For those interested, I would suggest you search on the internet for golden ratio examples, and you will be pleasantly surprised. Further into the ratio properties, one can find remarkable consistency when a number is in the Fibonacci series is divided by its immediate succeeding number.</p>\n<p>For example:<br/>\n89/144 = 0.618<br/>\n144/233 = 0.618<br/>\n377/610 = 0.618</p>\n<p>At this stage, do bear in mind that 0.618, when expressed in percentage is 61.8%.</p>\n<p>Similar consistency can be found when any number in the Fibonacci series is divided by a number two places higher.</p>\n<p>For example:<br/>\n13/34 = 0.382<br/>\n21/55 = 0.382<br/>\n34/89 = 0.382</p>\n<p>0.382, when expressed in percentage terms, is 38.2%</p>\n<p>Also, consistency is when a number in the Fibonacci series is divided by a number 3 place higher.</p>\n<p>For example:<br/>\n13/55 = 0.236<br/>\n21/89 = 0.236<br/>\n34/144 = 0.236<br/>\n55/233 = 0.236</p>\n<p>0.236, when expressed in percentage terms, is 23.6%.</p>\n<h2>16.1 – Relevance to stocks markets</h2>\n<p>It is believed that the Fibonacci ratios, i.e. 61.8%, 38.2%, and 23.6%, finds its application in stock charts. Fibonacci analysis can be applied when there is a noticeable up-move or down-move in prices.  Whenever the stock moves either upwards or downwards sharply, it usually tends to retrace back before its next move. For example, if the stock has run up from Rs.50 to Rs.100, it is likely to retrace back to probably Rs.70 before moving Rs.120.</p>\n<p>‘The retracement level forecast’ is a technique that can identify upto which level retracement can happen. These retracement levels provide a good opportunity for the traders to enter new positions in the trend direction.  The Fibonacci ratios, i.e. 61.8%, 38.2%, and 23.6%, help the trader identify the retracement’s possible extent. The trader can use these levels to position himself for trade.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the chart below:</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2Ch16-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-832\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"241\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart1.jpg 623w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart1-300x116.jpg 300w\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p>I’ve encircled two points on the chart, at Rs.380 where the stock started its rally and at Rs.489, where the stock prices peaked.</p>\n<p>I would now define the move of 109 (380 – 489) as the Fibonacci upmove.  As per the Fibonacci retracement theory, after the upmove one can anticipate a correction in the stock to last up to the Fibonacci ratios. For example, the first level up to which the stock can correct could be 23.6%. If this stock continues to correct further, the trader can watch out for the 38.2% and 61.8% levels.</p>\n<p>Notice in the example shown below, the stock had retraced up to 61.8%, which coincides with 421.9, before it resumed the rally.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2Ch16-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-833\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"241\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart2.jpg 622w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart2-300x116.jpg 300w\" width=\"622\"/></strong></p>\n<p>We can arrive at 421 by using simple math as well –</p>\n<p>Total Fibonacci up move = 109</p>\n<p>61.8% of Fibonacci up move = 61.8% * 109 = 67.36</p>\n<p>Retracement @ 61.8% = 489- 67.36 = 421.6</p>\n<p>Likewise, we can calculate for 38.2% and the other ratios. However one need not manually do this as the software will do this for us.</p>\n<p>Here is another example where the chart has rallied from Rs.288 to Rs.338. Therefore 50 points move makes up for the Fibonacci upmove. The stock retraced back 38.2% to Rs.319 before resuming its up move.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2Ch16-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-834\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"311\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart3.jpg 624w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart3-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>The Fibonacci retracements can also be applied to falling stocks to identify levels upto which the stock can bounce back. In the chart below (DLF Limited), the stock started to decline from Rs.187 to Rs. 120.6 thus making 67 points as the Fibonacci down move.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2Ch16-chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-835\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"149\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart4.jpg 624w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart4-300x72.jpg 300w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>After the down move, the stock attempted to bounce back retracing back to Rs.162, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level.</p>\n<h2>16.2 – Fibonacci Retracement construction</h2>\n<p>As we now know, Fibonacci retracements are movements in the chart that go against the trend. To use the Fibonacci retracements, we should first identify the 100% Fibonacci move. The 100% move can be an upward rally or a downward rally. To mark the 100% move, we need to pick the most recent peak and trough on the chart. Once this is identified, we connect them using a Fibonacci retracement tool. This is available in most of the technical analysis software packages including Zerodha’s Pi 🙂</p>\n<p>Here is a step by step guide:</p>\n<p>Step 1) Identify immediate peak and trough. In this case, the trough is at 150, and the peak is at 240. The 90 point moves make it 100%.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2Ch16-chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-836\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"193\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart5.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>Step 2) Select the Fibonacci retracement tool from the chart tools</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2Ch16-chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-837\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"219\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart6.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>Step 3) Use the Fibonacci retracement tool to connect the trough and the peak.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2Ch16-chart7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-838\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"227\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart7.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>After selecting the Fibonacci retracement tool from the charts tool, the trader has to click on trough first, and without un-clicking, he has to drag the line till the peak. While doing this, simultaneously, the Fibonacci retracements levels start getting plotted on the chart. However, the software completes the retracement identification process only after selecting both the trough and the peak. This is how the chart looks after selecting both points.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2Ch16-chart8\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-839\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"227\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart8.jpg 1331w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart8-300x109.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2Ch16-chart8-1024x373.jpg 1024w\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p>You can now see the Fibonacci retracement levels are calculated and loaded on the chart. Use this information to position yourself in the market.</p>\n<h2>16.3 – How should you use the Fibonacci retracement levels?</h2>\n<p>Think of a situation where you wanted to buy a particular stock, but you have not been able to do so because of a sharp run-up in the stock. The most prudent action to take would be to wait for a retracement in the stock in such a situation. Fibonacci retracement levels such as 61.8%, 38.2%, and 23.6% act as a potential level upto which a stock can correct.</p>\n<p>By plotting the Fibonacci retracement levels, the trader can identify these retracement levels, and therefore position himself for an opportunity to enter the trade. However please note like any indicator, use the Fibonacci retracement as a confirmation tool.</p>\n<p>I would buy a stock only after it has passed the other checklist items. In other words, my conviction to buy would be higher if the stock has:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Formed a recognizable candlestick pattern</li>\n<li>The stoploss coincides with the S&amp;R level.</li>\n<li>Volumes are above average.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Along with the above points, if the stoploss also coincides with the Fibonacci level, I know the trade setup is well aligned to all the variables, and hence I would go in for a strong buy. The word ‘strong’ usage indicates the level of conviction in the trade set up. The more confirming factors we use to study the trend and reversal, more robust is the signal. The same logic can also be applied for the short trade.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The Fibonacci series forms the basis for Fibonacci retracement</li>\n<li>A Fibonacci series has many mathematical properties. These mathematical properties are prevalent in many aspects of nature.</li>\n<li>Traders believe the Fibonacci series has its application in stock charts as it identified potential retracement levels.</li>\n<li>Fibonacci retracements are levels (61.8%, 38.2%, and 23.6% ) upto which a stock can retrace before it resumes the original directional move.</li>\n<li>At the Fibonacci retracement level, the trader can look at initiating a new trade.

The Dow Theory was used extensively even before the western world discovered candlesticks. In fact, even today, Dow Theory concepts are being used. In fact, traders blend the best practices from Candlesticks and Dow Theory.</p>\n<p>The Dow Theory was introduced to the world by Charles H. Dow, who also founded the Dow-Jones financial news service (Wall Street Journal). During his time, he wrote a series of articles starting from the 1900s which in the later years was referred to as ‘The Dow Theory’. Much credit goes to William P Hamilton, who compiled these articles with relevant examples over a period of 27 years. Much has changed since the time of Charles Dow, and hence there are supporters and critics of the Dow Theory.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch17-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-876\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch17-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch17-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch17-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>17.1 – The Dow Theory Principles</h2>\n<p>The Dow Theory is built on a few beliefs. These are called the Dow Theory tenets. Charles H Dow developed these tenets over the years of his observation on the markets. 9 tenets are considered as the guiding force behind the Dow Theory. They are as follows:</p>\n<table style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th width=\"5%\">Sl No</th>\n<th width=\"30%\">Tenet</th>\n<th width=\"65%\">What does it mean?</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>Indices discounts everything</td>\n<td>The stock market indices discount everything which is known &amp; unknown in the public domain. If a sudden and unexpected event occurs, the stock market indices quickly recalibrate itself to reflect the accurate value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>Overall there are 3 broad market trends.</td>\n<td>Primary Trend, Secondary Trend, and Minor Trends</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>The Primary Trend</td>\n<td>This is the major trend of the market that lasts from a year to several years. It indicates the broader multiyear direction of the market. While the long term investor is interested in the primary trend, an active trader is interested in all trends. The primary trend could be a primary uptrend or a primary downtrend</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>The Secondary Trend</td>\n<td>These are corrections to the primary trend. Think of this as a minor counter-reaction to the larger movement in the market. Example – corrections in the bull market, rallies &amp; recoveries in the bear market. The counter-trend can last anywhere between a few weeks to several months</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>Minor Trends/Daily fluctuations</td>\n<td>These are daily fluctuations in the market; some traders prefer to call them market noise</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td>All Indices must confirm with each other.</td>\n<td>We cannot confirm a trend based on just one index. For example, the market is bullish only if CNX Nifty, CNX Nifty Midcap, CNX Nifty Smallcap etc. all move in the same upward direction. It would not be possible to classify markets as bullish, just by the action of CNX Nifty alone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td>Volumes must confirm</td>\n<td>The volumes must confirm along with the price. The trend should be supported by volume. The volume must increase as the price rises and should reduce as the price falls in an uptrend. In a downtrend, the volume must increase when the price falls and decrease when the price rises. You could refer chapter 12 for more details on volume</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td>Sideway markets can substitute secondary markets.</td>\n<td>Markets may remain sideways (trading between a range) for an extended period. Example:- Reliance Industries between 2010 and 2013 was trading between 860 and 990. The sideways markets can be a substitute for a secondary trend</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td>The closing price is the most sacred.</td>\n<td>Between the open, high, low and close prices, the close is the most important price level as it represents the final evaluation of the stock during the day.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>17.2 – The different phases of Market</h2>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"phases\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-874\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"265\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/phases.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/phases.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/phases-300x133.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></strong></p>\n<p>Dow Theory suggests the markets are made up of three distinct phases, which are self-repeating. These are called the Accumulation phase, the Markup phase, and the Distribution phase.</p>\n<p>The Accumulation phase usually occurs right after a steep sell-off in the market. The steep sell-off in the markets would have frustrated many market participants, losing hope of any uptrend in prices. The stock prices would have plummeted to rock bottom valuations, but the buyers would still be hesitant to buy fearing another sell-off. Hence the stock price languishes at low levels. This is when the ‘Smart Money’ enters the market.</p>\n<p>Smart money is usually the institutional investors who invest in a long term perspective. They invariably seek value investments which are available after a steep sell-off. Institutional investors start to acquire shares regularly, in large quantities over an extended period of time. This is what makes up an accumulation phase. This also means that the sellers trying to sell during the accumulation phase will easily find buyers, and therefore the prices do not decline further. Hence invariably, the accumulation phase marks the bottom of the markets. More often than not, this is how the support levels are created. Accumulation phase can last up to several months.</p>\n<p>Once the institutional investors (smart money) absorb all the available stocks, short term traders since the support. This usually coincides with the improved business sentiment. These factors tend to take the stock price higher. This is called the markup phase. During the Markup phase, the stock price rallies quickly and sharply. The most important feature of the markup phase is speed. Because the rally is quick, the public at large is left out of the rally. New investors are mesmerized by the return, and everyone from the analysts to the public sees higher levels ahead.</p>\n<p>Finally, when the stock price reaches new highs (52 weeks high, all-time high), everyone around would be talking about the stock market. The news reports turn optimistic, business environment suddenly appears vibrant, and everyone (public) wants to invest in the markets. By and large, the public wants to get involved in the markets as there is a positive sentiment. This is when the distribution phase occurs.</p>\n<p>The judicious investors (smart investors) who got in early (during the accumulation phase) will start offloading their shares slowly. The public will absorb all the volumes offloaded by the institutional investors (smart money) there by giving them the well-needed price support. The distribution phase has similar price properties as that of the accumulation phase. Whenever the prices attempt to go higher in the distribution phase, the smart money offloads their holdings. Over a period of time, this action repeats several times, and thus the resistance level is created.</p>\n<p>Finally, when the institutional investors (smart money) completely sell off their holdings, there would no further support for prices. Hence, what follows after the distribution phase is a complete sell-off in the markets, also known as the mark down of prices. The selloff in the market leaves the public in an utter state of frustration.</p>\n<p>Completing the circle, what follows the selloff phase is a fresh round of accumulation phase, and the whole cycle repeats. It is believed that that entire cycle from the accumulation phase to the selloff spans over a few years.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that no two market cycles are the same. For example, in the Indian context, the bull market of 2006 – 07 is way different from the bull market of 2013-14. Sometimes the market moves from the accumulation to the distribution phase over a prolonged multi-year period. On the other hand, the same move from the accumulation to the distribution can happen over a few months. The market participant needs to tune himself to evaluating markets in the context of different phases, as this sets a stage for developing a view on the market.</p>\n<h2>17.3 – The Dow Patterns</h2>\n<p>Like in candlesticks, there are few important patterns in Dow Theory as well. The trader can use these patterns to identify trading opportunities. Some of the patterns that we will study are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Double bottom &amp; Double top formation</li>\n<li>The Triple Bottom &amp; Triple Top</li>\n<li>Range formation, and</li>\n<li>Flag formation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The support and resistance is also a core concept for the Dow Theory, but we have discussed it much earlier a chapter dedicated to it because of its importance (in terms of placing targets and stop-loss).</p>\n<h2>17.4 – The Double bottom and top formation</h2>\n<p>A double top &amp; double bottom is considered a reversal pattern. A double bottom occurs when a stock’s price hits a shallow price level and rebounds back with a quick recovery. Following the price recovery, the stock trades at a higher level (relative to the low price) for at least 2 weeks (well spaced in time). After which the stock attempts to hit back to the low price previously made. If the stock holds up once again and rebounds, then a double bottom is formed.</p>\n<p>A double bottom formation is considered bullish, and hence one should look at buying opportunities. Here is a chart that shows a double bottom formation in Cipla Limited:</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch17-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-844\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"212\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch17-Chart1.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>Notice the time interval between the two bottom formations. The price level was well spaced in time.</p>\n<p>Likewise, in a double top formation, the stock attempts to hit the same high price twice but eventually sells off. Of course, the time gap between the two attempts of crossing the high should at least be 2 weeks. In the chart below (Cairn India Ltd), we can notice the double top at 336 levels. On close observation, you will notice the first top was around Rs.336, and the second top was around Rs.332. With some amount of flexibility, a small difference such as this should be considered alright.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch17-Chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-845\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"195\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch17-Chart2.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p>From my own trading experience, I find both double tops and double bottoms handy while trading. I always look for opportunities where the double formation coincides with a recognizable candlesticks formation.</p>\n<p>For instance, imagine a situation wherein the double top formation, the 2<sup>nd</sup> top forms a bearish pattern such as a shooting star. This means, both from the Dow Theory and candlestick perspective there is consensus to sell; hence the conviction to take the trade is higher.</p>\n<h2>17.5 – The triple top and bottom</h2>\n<p>As you may have guessed, a triple formation is similar to a double formation, except that the price level is tested thrice as opposed twice in a double bottom. The interpretation of the triple formation is similar to the double formation.</p>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, the more number of times the price tests, and reacts to a certain price level, the more sacred the price level is considered. Therefore by this, the triple formation is considered more powerful than the double formation.</p>\n<p>The following chart shows a triple top formation for DLF Limited. Notice the sharp sell-off after testing the price level for the 3<sup>rd</sup> time, thus completing the triple top.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch17-Chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-846\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch17-Chart3.jpg\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Dow Theory was used in the western world even before candlesticks were formally introduced.</li>\n<li>Dow Theory works on 9 basic tenets.</li>\n<li>The market can be viewed in 3 basic phases – accumulation, mark up, and distribution phase.</li>\n<li>The accumulation phase is when the institutional investor (smart money) enters the market, mark up phase is when traders make an entry.

The stock attempts to hit the same upper and lower price level multiple times for an extended period of time in a range. This is also referred to as the sideways market. As the price oscillates in a narrow range without forming a particular trend, it is called a sideways market or sideways drift. So, when both the buyers and sellers are not confident about the market direction, the price would typically move in a range. Hence, typically long term investors would find the markets a bit frustrating during this period.</p>\n<p>However, the range provides multiple opportunities to trade both ways (long and short) with reasonable accuracy for a short term trader. The upside is capped by resistance and the downside by the support. Thus it is known as a range-bound market or a trading market as there are enough opportunities for both the buyers and the sellers.</p>\n<p>In the chart below, you can see the stock’s behaviour in a typical range:</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch18-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-853\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"229\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-Chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-Chart1.jpg 1322w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-Chart1-300x110.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-Chart1-1024x376.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>As you can see, the stock hit the same upper (Rs.165) and the same lower (Rs.128) level multiple times and continued to trade within the range. The area between the upper and lower level is called the width of the range. One of the easy trades to initiate in such a scenario would be to buy near the lower level and sell near the higher level. In fact, the trade can be both ways with the trader opting to short at a higher level and repurchasing it at the lower level.</p>\n<p>In fact, the chart above is a classic example of blending Dow Theory with candlestick patterns. Starting from left, notice the encircled candles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The bullish engulfing pattern is suggesting along.</li>\n<li>Morning doji star suggesting along</li>\n<li>Bearish engulfing pattern is suggesting a short</li>\n<li>Bearish harami pattern is suggesting a short</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The short term trader should not miss out such trades, as these are easy to identify trading opportunities with a high probability of being profitable. The duration of the range can be anywhere between a few weeks to a couple of years. The longer the duration of the range, the longer is the width of the range.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch18-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-880\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"268\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-title1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-title1.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-title1-300x134.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>18.2 – The range breakout</h2>\n<p>Stocks do break out of the range after being in the range for a long time. Before we explore this, it is interesting to understand why stocks trade in the range in the first place.</p>\n<p>Stocks can trade in the range for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When there are no meaningful fundamental triggers that can move the stock, these triggers are quarterly/ annual result announcements, new product launches, new geographic expansions, change in management, joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions, etc. When nothing is exciting or nothing bad about the company, the stock tends to trade in a trading range. The range under these circumstances could be quite long-lasting until a meaningful trigger occurs.</li>\n<li>In anticipation of a big announcement – When the market anticipates a big corporate announcement, the stock can swing in either direction based on the announcement’s outcome. Till the announcement is made both buyers and sellers would be hesitant to take action, and hence the stock gets into the range. The range under such circumstances can be short-lived lasting until the announcement (event) is made.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The stock after being in the range can break out of the range. The range breakout more often than not indicates the start of a new trend. The direction in which the stock will breakout depends on the nature of the trigger or the event’s outcome. What is more important is the breakout itself, and the trading opportunity it provides.</p>\n<p>A trader will take a long position when the stock price breaks the resistance levels and will go short after the support level breaks.</p>\n<p>Think of the range as an enclosed compression chamber where the pressure builds up on each passing day. With a small vent, the pressure eases out with a great force. This is how the breakout happens. However, the trader needs to be aware of the concept of a ‘false breakout’.</p>\n<p>A false breakout happens when the trigger is not strong enough to pull the stock in a particular direction. Loosely put, a false breakout happens when a ‘not so trigger friendly event’ occurs, and impatient retail market participants react to it. Usually, the volumes are low on false range breakouts indicating; there is no smart money involved in the move. After a false breakout, the stock usually falls back within the range.</p>\n<p>A true breakout has two distinct characteristics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Volumes are high and</li>\n<li>After the breakout, the momentum (rate of change of price) is high.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Have a look at the chart below:</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch18-Chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-854\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"254\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-Chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-Chart2.jpg 1322w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-Chart2-300x122.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-Chart2-1024x417.jpg 1024w\" width=\"624\"/></strong></p>\n<p>The stock attempted to break out of the range three times. However, the first two attempts were false breakouts. Low volumes and low momentum characterized the first 1st breakout (starting from left). The 2<sup>nd</sup> breakout was characterized by impressive volumes but lacked momentum.</p>\n<p>However, the 3<sup>rd</sup> breakout had the classic breakout attributes, i.e. high volumes and high momentum.</p>\n<h2>18.3 – Trading the range breakout</h2>\n<p>Traders buy the stock as soon as the stock breaks out of the range on good volumes. Good volumes confirm just one of the prerequisite of the range breakout. However, there is no way for the trader to figure out if the momentum (second prerequisite) will continue to build. Hence, the trader should always have a stoploss for range breakout trades.</p>\n<p>For example – Assume the stock is trading in a range between Rs.128 and Rs.165. The stock breaks out of the range and surges above Rs.165 and now trades at Rs.170. Then trader would be advised to go long 170 and place a stoploss at Rs.165.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, assume the stock breaks out at Rs.128 (also called the breakdown) and trades at Rs.123. The trader can initiate a short trade at Rs.123 and treat Rs.128 as the stoploss level.</p>\n<p>After initiating the trade, if the breakout is genuine, then the trader can expect a move in the stock that is at least equivalent to the range’s width. For example, with the breakout at Rs.168, the minimum target expectation would be 43 points since the width is 168 – 125 = 43. This translates to a price target of Rs.168+43 = 211.</p>\n<h2>18.4 – The Flag formation</h2>\n<p>The flag formation usually occurs when the stock posts a sustained rally with almost a vertical or a steep increase in stock prices. Flag patterns are marked by a big move which is followed by a short correction.  In the correction phase, the price would generally move within two parallel lines. Flag pattern takes the shape of a parallelogram or a rectangle, and they have the appearance of a flag on the pole. The price decline can last anywhere between 5 and 15 trading sessions.</p>\n<p><strong><img alt=\"M2-Ch18-Chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-855\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"228\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-Chart3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-Chart3.jpg 1325w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-Chart3-300x110.jpg 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M2-Ch18-Chart3-1024x375.jpg 1024w\" width=\"623\"/></strong></p>\n<p>With these two events (i.e. price rally, and price decline) occurring consecutively a flag formation is formed. When a flag forms, the stock invariably spurts back suddenly and continues to rally upwards.</p>\n<p>For a trader who has missed the opportunity to buy the stock, the flag formation offers a second chance to buy. However, the trader has to be quick in taking the position as the stock tends to move up suddenly. In the chart above, the sudden upward moved is quite evident.</p>\n<p>The logic behind the flag formation is fairly simple. The steep rally in the stock offers an opportunity for market participants to book profits. Invariably, the retail participants who are happy with the recent stock gains start booking profits by selling the stock. This leads to a decline in the stock price.  As only the retail participants are selling, the volumes are on the lower side. The smart money is still invested in the stock, and hence the sentiment is positive for the stock. Many traders see this as an opportunity to buy the stock, and hence the price rallies all of a sudden.</p>\n<h2>18.5 – The Reward to Risk Ratio (RRR)</h2>\n<p>The concept of reward to risk ratio (RRR) is generic and not really specific to Dow Theory. It would have been apt to discuss this under ‘trading systems and Risk management’. However, RRR finds its application across every trading type, be it trades based on technical analysis or investments through fundamentals. For this reason, we will discuss the concept of RRR here.</p>\n<p>The calculation of the reward to risk ratio is straightforward. Look at the details of this short term long trade:<br/>\nEntry: 55.75<br/>\nStop loss: 53.55<br/>\nExpected target: 57.20</p>\n<p>On the face of it, considering it is a short term trade, the trade looks alright. However, let us inspect this further:</p>\n<p>What is the risk the trader is taking? –  [Entry – Stoploss] i.e 55.75 – 53.55 = <strong>2.2</strong></p>\n<p>What is the reward the trader is expecting? – [Exit – Entry] i.e 57.2 – 55.75 = <strong>1.45</strong></p>\n<p>This means for a reward of 1.45 points the trader is risking 2.2 points or in other words, the Reward to Risk ratio is 1.45/2.2 = 0.65. Clearly, this is not a great trade.</p>\n<p>A good trade should be characterised by a rich RRR. In other words, for every Rs.1/- you risk on trade your expected return should be at least Rs.1.3/- or higher. Otherwise, it is simply not worth the risk.</p>\n<p>For example, consider this long trade:<br/>\nEntry: 107<br/>\nStop loss: 102<br/>\nExpected target: 114</p>\n<p>In this trade, the trader is risking Rs.5/- (107 – 102) for an expected reward of Rs.7/- (114 – 107). RRR, in this case, is 7/5 = 1.4. This means for every Rs.1/- of risk, the trader is assuming, he is expecting Rs.1.4 as a reward. Not a bad deal.</p>\n<p>The minimum RRR threshold should be set by each trader based on his/her risk appetite. For instance, personally, I wouldn’t say I like to take up trades with a RRR of less than 1.5. Some aggressive traders don’t mind a RRR of 1, meaning for every Rs.1 they risk they expect a reward of Rs.1. Some would prefer the RRR to be at least 1.25. Ultra cautious traders would prefer their RRR to be upwards of 2, meaning for every Rs.1/- of risk they would expect at least Rs.2 as a reward.</p>\n<p>A trade must qualify the trader’s RRR requirement. Remember, a low RRR is just not worth the trade. Ultimately if RRR is not satisfied, then even a trade that looks attractive must be dropped as it is just not worth the risk.</p>\n<p>To give you a perspective think about this hypothetical situation:</p>\n<p>A bearish engulfing pattern has been formed, right at the top end of a trade. The point at which the bearish engulfing pattern has formed also marks a double top formation. The volumes are beautiful as they are at least 30% more than the 10-day average volumes. Near the bearish engulfing patterns high, the chart is showing medium-term support.</p>\n<p>In the above situation, everything seems perfectly aligned with a short trade. Assume the trade details are as below:<br/>\nEntry: 765.67<br/>\nStop loss: 772.85<br/>\nTarget: 758.5<br/>\nRisk: 7.18 (772.85 – 765.67) i.e [Stoploss – Entry]<br/>\nReward: 7.17 (765.67 – 758.5) i.e [Entry – Exit]<br/>\nRRR: 7.17/7.18 = ~ 1.0</p>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, I do have a stringent RRR requirement of at least 1.5. For this reason, even though the trade above looks great, I would be happy to drop it and move on to scout the next opportunity.</p>\n<p>As you may have guessed by now, RRR finds a spot in the checklist.</p>\n<h2>18.6 – The Grand Checklist</h2>\n<p>Having covered all the important technical analysis aspects,  we now need to look at the checklist again and finalize it. As you may have guessed, Dow Theory obviously finds a place in the checklist as it provides another round of confirmation to initiate the trade.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The stock should form a recognisable candlestick pattern.</li>\n<li>S&amp;R should confirm to the trade. The stoploss price should be around S&amp;R.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>For a long trade, the low of the pattern should be around the support.</li>\n<li>For a short trade, the high of the pattern should be around the resistance.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Volumes should confirm\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Ensure above average volumes on both buy and sell day</li>\n<li>Low volumes are not encouraging, and hence do feel free to hesitate while taking trade where the volumes are low.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Look at the trade from the Dow Theory perspective.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Primary, secondary trends</li>\n<li>Double, triple, range formations</li>\n<li>Recognisable Dow formation</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Indicators should confirm\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Scale the trade size higher if indicators confirm to your plan of action</li>\n<li>If the indicators do not confirm go ahead with the original plan</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>RRR should be satisfactory\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Think about your risk appetite and identify your RRR threshold</li>\n<li>For a complete beginner, I would suggest the RRR be as high as possible as this provides a margin of safety.</li>\n<li>For an active trader, I would suggest a RRR of at least 1.5</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you identify a trading opportunity, always look at how the trade is positioned from the Dow Theory perspective. For example, if you consider a long trade based on candlesticks, then look at what the primary and secondary trend is suggesting. If the primary trend is bullish, then it would be a good sign, however, if we are in the secondary trend (which is counter to the primary), you may want to think twice as the immediate trend is counter to the long trade.</p>\n<p>If you follow the checklist mentioned above and completely understand its importance, I can assure you that your trading will improve multiple folds. So the next time you take a trade, ensure you comply with an above checklist. If not for anything, at least you will have no reason to initiate a trade based on loose and unscientific logic.</p>\n<h2>18.7 – What next?</h2>\n<p>We have covered many aspects of technical analysis in this module. I can assure you the topics covered here are good enough to put you on a strong platform. You may believe there is a need to explore other patterns and indicators that we have not discussed here. If we have not discussed a pattern or an indicator here on Varsity, do remember it is for a specific purpose. So be assured that you have all that you need to begin your journey with Technical analysis.</p>\n<p>If you can devote time to understanding each one of these topics thoroughly, then you can be certain about developing a strong TA based thinking framework. The next logical progression from here would be to explore ideas behind backtesting trading strategies, risk management, and trading psychology—all of which we will cover in the subsequent modules.</p>\n<p>In the next concluding chapter, we will discuss a few practical aspects that will help you start with Technical Analysis.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong>Key takeaways from this chapter</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>A range is formed when the stock oscillates between the two price points.</li>\n<li>A trader can buy at the lower price point, and sell at a higher price point.</li>\n<li>The stock gets into a range for a specific reason such as the lack of fundamental triggers, or event expectation.</li>\n<li>The stock can break out of the range.

If you have read through all the chapters and understood what is being discussed, you are certainly at a stage where you can start trading based on Technical Analysis. The objective of this chapter is to help you get started by identifying technical trading opportunities.</p>\n<p>Kindly note, the suggestions I have put forth in this chapter are based on my trading experience.</p>\n<p>To begin with, you need a chart visualization software, called the ‘Charting Software’. The charting software helps you look at the various stock charts and analyze the same. Needless to say, the charting software is an essential tool for a technical analyst.</p>\n<p>There are many charting software’s available. The two most popular ones are ‘Metastock’ and ‘Amibroker’. Majority of the technical analysts use one of the two charting software’s. Needless to say, these are paid software’s, and you need to purchase the software license before using it.</p>\n<p>A few online free charting tools are available that you can use – these are available on Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and pretty much all the business media websites. However, my advice to you is – if you aspire to become a technical analyst, get access to good charting software.</p>\n<p>Think of the charting software as a DVD player; once you have a DVD player installed, you will still need to rent DVDs to watch movies. Similarly, once you have a charting software installed, you will still need to feed it with data to view the charts. The data feed required provided by the data vendors.</p>\n<p>There are many data vendors in India, giving you access to data feeds. I would suggest you look upon the internet for reliable vendors.  You need to inform the data vendor which charting software you have, and he will provide you with the data feeds in a format that is compatible with your charting software. Of course, the data feeds come at a cost. Once you sign up with a data vendor, he will first give you all the historical data, after which you will have to update the data from his server daily to stay current.</p>\n<p>From my experience buying the latest version of a good charting software (Metastock or Amibroker) can cost you a onetime fee of anywhere between Rs.25,000/- and Rs.30,000/-. Add to this another Rs.15,000/- to Rs.25,000 towards the data feeds. Of course, while the software cost is one time, the cost of data feeds recurs annually. Do note, the older versions of the charting software may cost you much lesser.</p>\n<p>Now, if you are in no mood to spend so much for the charting software &amp; data feed combination, there is another alternative. And that would be Zerodha’s Pi.</p>\n<p>As you may know, Zerodha has a proprietary trading terminal called ‘Pi’. Pi helps you in many ways; I would like to draw your attention to some of its features in the context of Technical Analysis:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>It is bundled</strong> – Pi is a charting software and a data feed package bundled into a single software.</li>\n<li><strong>Great Visualizations</strong> – Pi helps you visualize charts across multiple time frames, including intraday charts.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced Features</strong> – Pi has advanced charting features and includes 80 built-in technical indicators and over 30 drawing tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Scripting you strategy</strong> – Pi has a scripting language employing which you can code technical strategies and backtest the same on historical data. Please do note, on Varsity we will soon include a module on building trading strategies and scripting.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy Opportunity Recognition</strong> – Pi has a pattern recognition feature that lets you draw a screen pattern. Once you draw, command Pi to scout for that pattern across the market, and it will do just that for you.</li>\n<li><strong>Trade from Pi</strong> – Pi also lets you execute trades directly from the chart (a huge plus point for a technical trader)</li>\n<li><strong>Data Dump</strong> – Pi has a massive historical data dump (over 50,000 candles) which means backtesting your strategy will be more efficient.</li>\n<li><strong>Your personal trading assistant</strong> – Pi’s ‘Expert Advisor’, keeps you informed about the patterns being developed in the live markets.</li>\n<li><strong>Super Advanced features</strong> – Pi has Artificial Intelligence and Genetic Algorithms. These are optimisation tools which help you optimize your trading algorithms.</li>\n<li><strong>It is free </strong>– Zerodha is giving it free of cost to all its active traders.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The list is quite exhaustive, ranging from the basic to advanced features. I would strongly suggest you try out Pi before deciding to venture out for charting package and data feed bundle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M2-Ch19-illustration6.jpg\"><img alt=\"M2-Ch19-illustration6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1174\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M2-Ch19-illustration6.jpg\" width=\"250\"/></a></p>\n<h2>19.2 – Which timeframe to choose?</h2>\n<p>We discussed ‘Timeframes in chapter 3. I would request you to read through it again to refresh your memory.</p>\n<p>Selecting the timeframe while scanning for trading opportunities is perhaps one of the biggest confusion a newbie technical analyst has. You can choose many timeframes from – 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, EOD, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly.  It is quite easy to get confused about this.</p>\n<p>As a thumb rule, the higher the timeframe, the more reliable the trading signal is. For example, a ‘Bullish Engulfing’ pattern on the 15-minute timeframe is far more reliable than a ‘Bullish Engulfing’ pattern on a 5-minute timeframe. Keeping this in perspective, one has to choose a timeframe based on the intended length of the trade.</p>\n<p>So how do you decide the intended length of your trade?</p>\n<p>If you are starting fresh or not a seasoned trader, I suggest you avoid day trading. Start with trades to hold the trade for a few days. This is called ‘Positional Trading’ or ‘Swing Trading’. An active swing trader usually keeps his trading position open for a few days. The best lookback period for a swing trader is 6 months to 1 year.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a scalper is a seasoned day trader; typically, he uses 1minute or 5 minutes timeframe.</p>\n<p>Once you are comfortable with holding trades over multiple days, graduate yourself to ‘Day Trading’. My guess is, your transition from a positional trader to a day trader will take some time. Needless to say for a dedicated and disciplined trader, the transition period is remarkably lesser.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch19-illustration3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1171\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M2-Ch19-illustration3.jpg\" width=\"250\"/></p>\n<h2>19.3 – Lookback period</h2>\n<p>Look back period is simply the number of candles you wish to view before taking a trading decision. For instance, a lookback period of 3 months means you are looking at today’s candle in the backdrop of at least the recent 3 months data. By doing this, you will develop a perspective on today’s price action concerning last 3 months price action.</p>\n<p>For swing trading opportunities, what is the ideal look back period? From my experience, I would suggest that a swing trader should look for at least 6 months to 1-year data. Likewise, a scalper is better off looking at the last 5 days data.</p>\n<p>However, while plotting the S&amp;R levels, you should increase the look back period to at least 2 years.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch19-illustration4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1172\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M2-Ch19-illustration4.jpg\" width=\"250\"/></p>\n<h2>19.4 – The opportunity universe</h2>\n<p>There are roughly about 6000 listed stocks in the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and close to about 2000 listed stocks in the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Does it make sense for you to scan for opportunities across these thousands of stocks, daily? Obviously not. Over a period of time, you need to identify a set of stocks that you are comfortable trading. These set of stocks would constitute your “Opportunity Universe’. Daily, you scan your opportunity universe to identify trading opportunities.</p>\n<p>Here are some pointers to select stocks to build your opportunity universe:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure the stock has adequate liquidity. One way to ensure adequate liquidity is to look at the bid-ask spread. The lesser the spread, the more liquid the stock\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Alternatively, you can have ‘minimum volume criteria’. For example, you can consider only those stocks where the volume per day is at least 500000</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Make sure the stock is in the ‘EQ’ segment. This is basically because stocks in the ‘EQ’ segment can be day traded. I agree, I discouraged day trading for a newbie, however in a situation where you initiated a positional trade and the target is achieved the same day, there is no harm in closing the position intraday.</li>\n<li>This is a bit tricky, but make sure the stock is not operator driven. Unfortunately, there is no quantifiable method to identify operator driven stocks. This comes to you by sheer experience.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you find it difficult to find stocks that comply with the above points, I would advise you to stick to the Nifty 50 or the Sensex 30 stocks. These are called the index stocks. The exchanges carefully select index stocks; this selection process ensures they comply with many points, including those mentioned above.</p>\n<p>Keeping Nifty 50 as your opportunity universe is probably a good idea for both swing trader and scalper.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch19-illustration5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1173\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M2-Ch19-illustration5.jpg\" width=\"250\"/></p>\n<h2>19.5 – The Scout</h2>\n<p>Let us now proceed to understand how one should go about selecting stocks for trading. In other words, we will try and identify a process, employing which we can scan for trading opportunities. The process is mainly suited for a swing trader.</p>\n<p>We have now set the 4 important aspects –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The charting software – Suggest you use Zerodha’s Pi</li>\n<li>Timeframe – End of Day data</li>\n<li>Opportunity Universe – Nifty 50 stocks</li>\n<li>Trade type – Positional trades with an option to square off intraday, provided the target hits the same day.</li>\n<li>Look back period – Between 6 months to 1 year. Increase to 2 years while plotting the S&amp;R level</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Having fixed these important practical aspects, I will now share my methodology of scanning trading opportunities. I have divided the process into 2 parts:</p>\n<p><strong> Part 1 – The   Shortlisting process</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>I look at the chart of all the stocks within my opportunity universe.</li>\n<li>While looking at the chart, my attention is only on the recent 3 or maximum of 4 candles</li>\n<li>While looking at the recent 3 candles, I check if any recognisable candlestick pattern is developed.</li>\n<li>If I find an interesting pattern, I shortlist this stock for further investigation, and I continue the scouting process. I always ensure I check all the 50 charts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Part 2 – The Evaluation process</strong></p>\n<p>At this stage, I am usually left with 4-5 shortlisted stocks (out of the 50 stocks in my opportunity universe) which exhibit a recognisable candlestick pattern. I then proceed to evaluate these 4-5 charts in detail. Typically I spend at least 15 – 20 minutes on each chart. Here is what I do when looking at the shortlisted chart:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I generally look at how strong the pattern is – I am specifically interested in checking if there is any need for me to be more flexible.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>For example, if a Bullish Marubuzo has a shadow, I evaluate the shadow’s length concerning the range.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>After this, I look at the ‘prior trend’. For all bullish patterns, the prior trend should be a downtrend, and for all bearish patterns, the prior trend should be an uptrend. I do pay a lot of attention to prior trends.</li>\n<li>At this stage, if everything looks good (i.e. I have identified a recognizable pattern with a well defined prior trend), I proceed to inspect the chart further.</li>\n<li>After this, I look at the volumes. The volume should be at least equal to or more than the 10-day average volume.</li>\n<li>Provided both the candlestick pattern and volumes confirm, I then check the support (in case of a long trade) and resistance (in case of a short trade) level.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The S&amp;R level should coincide (as much as possible) with the stoploss of the trade (as defined by the candlestick pattern)</li>\n<li>If the S&amp;R level is more than 4% away from the stoploss, I stop evaluating the chart further and proceed to the next chart.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>I then look for Dow patterns, particularly for double and triple top &amp; bottom formations, flags formations, and a range breakout possibility.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Needless to say, I also establish the Primary and secondary market trend.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If the steps 1 to 5 are satisfactory, I proceed to calculate the risk to reward ratio (RRR)\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>To calculate RRR, I first establish the target by plotting either the support or resistance level.</li>\n<li>The minimum RRR should be at least 1.5</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Finally, I look at the MACD and RSI indicators to get a perspective if they confirm, and if I have spare cash, I increase my trade size.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Usually out of the 4-5 shortlisted stocks, at the most 1 or 2 may qualify for a trade. There are days when there are no trading opportunities. Deciding not to trade in itself is a big trading decision. Remember this is a fairly stringent checklist; if a stock is confirming the checklist, my conviction to trade is very high.</p>\n<p>I have mentioned this many times in this module; I will mention this for one last time – once you place a trade, do nothing until your target is achieved, or stoploss is triggered. Of course, you can trail your stoploss, which is a healthy practice. Otherwise, do nothing if your trade complies with the checklist and do remember the trade is highly curetted; hence the chance of being successful is high. So it makes sense to stay put with conviction.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M2-Ch19-illustration2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1176\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M2-Ch19-illustration21.jpg\" width=\"250\"/></p>\n<h2>19.5 – The Scalper</h2>\n<p>For a seasoned swing trader, scalping is another option. Scalping is a technique where the trader initiates a fairly large trade to hold the trade for a few minutes. Here is a typical example of the trade done by a scalper –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>1st Leg of the trade</th>\n<th>2nd leg of the trade</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Time – 10:15 AM</td>\n<td>Time – 10:25 AM</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stock – Infosys</td>\n<td>Stock – Infosys</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Price – 3980</td>\n<td>Price – 3976</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Action – Sell</td>\n<td>Action – Buy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Quantity – 1000 shares</td>\n<td>Quantity – 1000 shares</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Overall profit after applicable charges = Rs.2644/-</p>\n<p>The overall profit is calculated considering that you are trading with Zerodha, the overall profitability would shrink remarkably if you are scalping with expensive brokerage rates. Containing transaction charges is one of the keys to successful scalping.</p>\n<p>A scalper is a highly focused trader with a sharp sense for the price. He utilizes exact charts such with 1 minute and 5-minute timeframe to make his trading decisions. A successful scalper executes many such trades within the day. His objective is simple – large quantity trade intending to hold for a few minutes. He intends to profit from the small moves in the stock.</p>\n<p>If you aspire to be a scalper, here are few guidelines –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remember the checklist we have mentioned but do not expect all the checklist items to comply as the trade duration is very low.</li>\n<li>If I were to handpick just 1 or 2 items in the checklist for scalping, it would be candlestick pattern and volume.</li>\n<li>A risk-reward ratio of even 0.5 to 0.75 is acceptable while scalping.</li>\n<li>Scalping should be done only on liquid stocks.</li>\n<li>Have an effective risk management system – be really quick to book a loss if need be</li>\n<li>Keep a tab on the bid-ask spread to see how the volumes are building.</li>\n<li>Keep a tab on global markets – for example, if there is a sudden drop in the Hang Seng (Hong Kong stock exchange) it invariably leads to a sudden drop in local markets.</li>\n<li>Choose a low-cost broker to ensure your costs are controlled.</li>\n<li>Use margins effectively do not over leverage.</li>\n<li>Have a reliable intraday charting software</li>\n<li>If you sense the day is going wrong, stop trading and move away from your terminal.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Scalping is a day trading technique requires a great presence of mind and a machine-like approach. A successful scalper embraces volatility and is indifferent to market swings.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>If you aspire to become a technical trader, ensure you equip yourself with good charting software.

Bill Williams saw the alligator’s behaviour as an allegory of the market’s one: the resting phase is turning into the price-hunting as the alligator awakes so that to come back to sleep after the feeding is over.

Change chose this name because the indicators are designed to reveal the beginning of a new trend. The Aroon indicators measure the number of periods since price recorded an x-day high or low. There are two separate indicators: Aroon-Up and Aroon-Down.</p>\n<p>A 25-day Aroon-Up measures the number of days since a 25-day high. A 25-day Aroon-Down measures the number of days since a 25-day low. In this sense, the Aroon indicators are quite different from typical momentum oscillators, focusing on price relative to time. Aroon is unique because it focuses on time relative to price. Chartists can use the Aroon indicators to spot emerging trends, identify consolidations, define correction periods and anticipate reversals. <em>Source: stockcharts.com</em></p>\n<p><strong>What should you know?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The indicator measures the number of days since last high or low is made. Hence the indicator is a measure of time relative to the price.</li>\n<li>Aroon consists of two-component – Aroon up and Aroon Down.</li>\n<li>The default value for Aroon is 25 days. Aroon up measures the number of days since the last 25 day high occurred and Aroon down measures the number of days since the last 25 days low has occurred</li>\n<li>Both Aroon up and Aroon down are plotted side by side.</li>\n<li>Aroon Up/Down is lower bound to zero and upper bound to 100</li>\n<li>A buy is generated when Aroon up is above 50 and Aroon low is below 30</li>\n<li>A sell is generated when Aroon down is above 50, and Aroon up is below 30</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>On Kite:<br/>\n</strong>Here is the snapshot of the indicator when loaded from studies –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-5_aroon-load.png\"><img alt=\"Image 5_aroon load\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3102\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-5_aroon-load.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-5_aroon-load.png 817w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-5_aroon-load-300x150.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, the default period is 14, feel free to change this to any number, you wish. 14 here represent the ‘number of days’.

The Aroon Oscillator measures the difference between the Aroon up and Aroon down and plots the difference in the form of an oscillator. The oscillator swings between -100 to +100, with the ‘0’ level as the centre point.</p>\n<p>The snapshot below shows the Aroon Oscillator loaded on to the chart –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-7_Aroon-Osc.png\"><img alt=\"Image 7_Aroon Osc\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3104\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"417\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-7_Aroon-Osc.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-7_Aroon-Osc.png 835w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-7_Aroon-Osc-300x156.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>A reading above zero means that Aroon-Up is greater than Aroon-Down, which implies that prices make new highs more recently than new lows. Conversely, readings below zero indicate that Aroon-Down is greater than Aroon-Up. This implies that prices are recording new lows more recently than new highs.</p>\n<p>As you can see, the Aroon Oscillator is either going to be positive or negative the vast majority of the time. This makes interpretation straight-forward—time and price favour an uptrend when the indicator is positive and a downtrend when it is negative. A positive or negative threshold can be used to define the strength of the trend. For example, a surge above +50 would reflect a strong upside move, while a plunge below -50 would indicate a strong downside move. <em>Source: stockcharts.com</em></p>\n<h2>Average True Range</h2>\n<p><strong>About:<br/>\n</strong>Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator that measures volatility. As with most of his indicators, Wilder designed ATR with commodities and daily prices in mind. Commodities are frequently more volatile than stocks. They were are often subject to gaps and limit moves, which occur when a commodity opens up or down its maximum allowed move for the session. A volatility formula based only on the high-low range would fail to capture volatility from gap or limit moves. Wilder created the Average True Range to capture this “missing” volatility. It is important to remember that ATR does not indicate the price direction, just volatility. <em>Source: stockcharts.com</em></p>\n<p><strong>What should you know?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Average True Range (ATR) is an extension of the True Range concept.</li>\n<li>ATR is no upper or lower bound, hence can take any value</li>\n<li>ATR is stock price specific, hence for Stock 1 ATR can be in the range of 1.2 and Stock 2 ATR could be in the range of 150</li>\n<li>ATR attempts to measure the volatility situation and not really the direction of the prices</li>\n<li>ATR is used to identify stop loss as well</li>\n<li>If the ATR of a stock is 48, then it means that the stock is likely to move 48 points either ways up or down on average. You can add this to the current day’s range to estimate the day’s range. For example, the stock price is 1320; then the stock is likely to trade between 1320 – 48 = <strong>1272</strong> and 1320 + 48 = <strong>1368</strong></li>\n<li>If the ATR for the next day decreases to say 40, then it means that the volatility is decreasing, and so is the expected range for the day.</li>\n<li>It is best to use ATR to identify the volatility-based SL while trading. Assume you have initiated a long trade on the stock at 1325, then your SL should be at least 1272 or below since the ATR is 48</li>\n<li>Likewise, if you have initiated a short at 1320, then your stoploss should be at least 1368 or above.</li>\n<li>If these SL levels are outside your risk to reward appetite, then its best to avoid such trade.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>On Kite:<br/>\n</strong>As you can see, the default value of ATR is 14, which means to say that the system calculates the ATR for the last 14 days. Of course, you can change this to any value to wish.

The idea is to plot an envelope around the stock price to evaluate if the stock prices are behaving “normally” or trending in a particular direction. To do this, the ATR band calculates the upper and lower band.</p>\n<p><strong>What should you know?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The ATR band calculates and plots the upper and lower envelope around the stock price.</li>\n<li>To begin with, a moving average of the stock price is calculated.</li>\n<li>The ATR value is added to the moving average value, and this forms the upper envelope.</li>\n<li>The ATR value is subtracted to the moving average value, and this forms the lower envelope.</li>\n<li>If the stock price penetrates either the upper or lower envelop, the expectation is that the stock price will continue to move in the same direction. For example, if the stock price has penetrated above the upper envelop, the expectation is that the stock will continue to move higher.</li>\n<li>You can even use the ATR bands as an alternative to the Bollinger Bands trading system. You can read more about the <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/indicators-part-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Bollinger Band (section 15.2)</strong></a></li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>On Kite:<br/>\n</strong>When you load the ATR band from studies, you will be prompted for a few inputs –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-10_ATRB_load.png\"><img alt=\"Image 10_ATRB_load\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3107\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"463\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-10_ATRB_load.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-10_ATRB_load.png 320w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-10_ATRB_load-207x300.png 207w\" width=\"320\"/></a></p>\n<p>Period refers to the MA time frame; the default value is 5 days. You can change this to whichever time frame that you deem suitable. We would suggest you ignore the ‘shift’ parameter.

The supertrend indicator is plotted over the price chart of the stock or the index. The indicator line changes its colour between green and red based on the price moment in the underlying. The super trend does not predict the direction, rather once the direction is established, it will guide you by initiating a position and suggesting that you stay in the position until the trend sustains.</p>\n<p><strong>What should you know?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>When plotted, the supertrend indicator appears like an alternating green and red continuous line.</li>\n<li>A buy signal is generated when the stock/index price turns greater than the indicator value. At this stage, the indicator colour turns green, and you can also see a crossover of the price versus the indicator (price greater than indicator value)</li>\n<li>Once the long position has been established, the trader is advised to hold the position till the price closes below the green line. So in a sense, the green line helps as a trailing stoploss for the long position.</li>\n<li>A sell signal is generated when the stock/index price turns lesser than the indicator value. At this stage, the indicator colour turns red, and you can also see a crossover of the price versus the indicator (price lesser than indicator value)</li>\n<li>The sell signal can be used to initiate a fresh short or exit long. Although waiting for the sell signal to exit the existing long position can sometimes lead to the loss. So the trader should use his discretion here.</li>\n<li>Once the short position has been established, the trader is advised to hold the position till the price closes below the green line. So in a sense, the red line helps as a trailing stoploss for the short position.</li>\n<li>Supertrend is basically used to identify a trend. Therefore, it works best in a trending market.</li>\n<li>The supertrend indicator, when compared to a regular Moving Average trading system generates fewer false signals; for this reason, the super trend indicator is preferred over a Moving Average trading system.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>On Kite:<br/>\n</strong>When you select the Supertrend indicator from the list of studies, you will be prompted for two inputs – Period and Multiplier.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-12_supertrend-load.png\"><img alt=\"Image 12_supertrend load\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3109\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"441\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-12_supertrend-load.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-12_supertrend-load.png 817w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-12_supertrend-load-300x165.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Period refers to the ATR number of days. The default value on Kite is 7, which means that the system will calculate the ATR value for the last 7 days. You can input any value you deem suitable.</p>\n<p>The multiplier refers to a value by which the ATR will get multiplied. The default value on Kite is 3, so whatever is the ATR value, it will get multiplied by 3. The multiplier is a crucial input for Super trend. If the multiplier value is too high, then a lesser number of signals are generated. Likewise, if the multiplier value is too small, then the frequency of signals increase, hence chances of generating false trading signals are quite high. I would suggest you keep this value between 3 and 4.</p>\n<p>Once the indicator is plotted, this is how it appears on the chart –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-13_supertrend_create.png\"><img alt=\"Image 13_supertrend_create\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3110\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"406\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-13_supertrend_create.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-13_supertrend_create.png 816w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-13_supertrend_create-300x152.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Notice how the indicator changes the colour as the price moves. Also, whenever the buy/sell signal is generated, green and red arrows are generated (respectively) prompting the trader to go long or short on the stock.<br/>\n<span id=\"vwap\"> </span></p>\n<h2>Volume weighted average price (VWAP)</h2>\n<p>VWAP is one of the simplest indicators to use. It works on the principle of averaging the traded price in terms of volume traded. Let me give you an example to help you understand this better.</p>\n<p>Here is how Infy traded between 14:30 and 14:35 on 2<sup>nd</sup> Nov 2016 –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-14_VWAP.png\"><img alt=\"image-14_vwap\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3899\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"143\" sizes=\"(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-14_VWAP.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-14_VWAP.png 363w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-14_VWAP-300x118.png 300w\" width=\"363\"/></a></p>\n<p>The data is quite simple to understand; for example, at 14:32, 2475 shares were traded; it made a high of 983.95, low of 983, and closed the minute at 983.1.</p>\n<p>Now, we use this data and compute the VWAP price. To do this, we calculate the following –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Typical price = which is the average price of High, Low, and close</li>\n<li>Volume Price (VP) = we get this by multiplying the typical price with its volume.</li>\n<li>Total VP = This is a cumulative number, which is got by adding the current VP to the previous VP</li>\n<li>Total volume = This is again a cumulative number, which is got by adding the current volume to the previous volume.</li>\n<li>VWAP = We get this VWAP number by dividing the Total VP by Total Volume. The resulting number indicates the average traded price, weighted by volume.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s do the math on Infy data –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-15_VWAP.png\"><img alt=\"image-15_vwap\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3900\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"143\" sizes=\"(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-15_VWAP.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-15_VWAP.png 795w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-15_VWAP-300x54.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-15_VWAP-768x138.png 768w\" width=\"795\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you see, the VWAP is a dynamic number, changing based on how the trades flow in.</p>\n<p><strong>How to use the VWAP?</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>VWAP is an intraday indicator, use it on minute charts. Often when you plot this, you will notice a jump at 9:15 AM, when compared to previous day’s data. Ignore this jump as it means nothing</li>\n<li>VWAP is an average, and like any indicators employing averages, this too lags the current market price</li>\n<li>VWAP is used for 2 main reasons – to get a sense of intraday direction and to get a sense of the efficiency of order execution</li>\n<li>If the current price is below VWAP, then the general opinion is that the intraday trend is down.</li>\n<li>If the current price is above VWAP, then the general opinion is that the stock is trending higher.</li>\n<li>If the VWAP lies in between the high and low, then the expectation is that the stock will remain volatile.</li>\n<li>If you intend to short a stock, it is considered an efficient fill if you short the stock at a higher price than VWAP.</li>\n<li>Likewise, if you intend to go long on a stock, it is considered an efficient fill if you go long at a price lower than VWAP.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>On Kite:</strong></p>\n<p>Open the chart of your preference and select VWAP from the studies dropdown –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-16_VWAP.png\"><img alt=\"image-16_vwap\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3901\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"468\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-16_VWAP.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-16_VWAP.png 862w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-16_VWAP-300x175.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-16_VWAP-768x449.png 768w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Note, VWAP can be applied only on an intraday time frame and cannot be applied on EOD data.</p>\n<p>Once you select the time frame (1 min, 5 mins, 10 mins etc.), the engine calculates the VWAP and plots it on the chart as an overlay.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-17_VWAP.png\"><img alt=\"image-17_vwap\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3902\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"469\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-17_VWAP.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-17_VWAP.png 870w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-17_VWAP-300x176.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Image-17_VWAP-768x450.png 768w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>You can now visualize the VWAP and the current market price and plan your trades accordingly.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

Here is the <a href=\"https://tradingqna.com/t/tradingview-charts-are-now-live-on-kite-web/55632\"><strong>TradingQ&amp;A post</strong></a> announcing the beta launch.</p>\n<p>Given this, I could share a few of my favourite features on Tradingview (TV), and hopefully, this will help you, especially if you are new to TV. I do not intend to discuss the most obvious charting features on TV, which I’m guessing would be quite intuitive to understand. These are a few offbeat ones, comes in quite handy when you are working with the charts.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-505\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch4-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch4-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/M2-Ch4-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2><strong>21.1 Multi timeframe settings</strong></h2>\n<p>This feature is not specific to TV, but I feel that this works better on TV compared to other platforms. I’m sure most of you are fairly familiar with the layout options.</p>\n<p>Imagine, you intend to trade ‘Indigo’ on an intraday basis.  One of the things, you’d want to look at before placing the order is how Indigo’s price looks on different time frames. The regular practice changes the frequency from 1 day to say, 15 minutes or 5 minutes. While this serves the purpose, it would be nice to see how the chart looks at different periods on a continuous and simultaneous basis. This helps you anchor the price and build a perspective of where the current market price concerns other timeframes. For example, I like to look at the 1-day chart, 30-minute chart, and 15-minute chart, all at the same time.</p>\n<p>You can do this fairly easily with TV. Here is how –</p>\n<p>Click on the ‘Select Layout’, an option available at the top right corner, and a select a layout you are comfortable with. Since I want 3 charts, I’ve picked a 3 chart layout which suits my preference.<a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-1_TV.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5375 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"828\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1914px) 100vw, 1914px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-1_TV.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-1_TV.png 1914w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-1_TV-300x130.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-1_TV-768x332.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-1_TV-1024x443.png 1024w\" width=\"1914\"/></a></p>\n<p>Once you pick the layout, this is how the chart layout appears. Notice all the three charts now displays the same scrip, same time frame, i.e. Indigo’s 1-day chart –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-2_layout.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5376\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"885\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1905px) 100vw, 1905px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-2_layout.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-2_layout.png 1905w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-2_layout-300x139.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-2_layout-768x357.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-2_layout-1024x476.png 1024w\" width=\"1905\"/></a></p>\n<p>Also note, the one on the left panel is highlighted within the three charts, which is evident with the blue border.</p>\n<p>The next step is to change the time frame across the three periods. My personal preference is to keep the left panel to the frequency that I intend to trade on, i.e. 15 minutes, the right top panel would be 30 mins, and the right bottom panel would be 1 day. You can change the time-frequency by clicking on the chart (when you do so, the chart is highlighted and a blue border appears), and changing the frequency to your desired one. A red arrow highlights the option to change the frequency.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-3_load.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5377\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"887\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1861px) 100vw, 1861px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-3_load.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-3_load.png 1861w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-3_load-300x143.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-3_load-768x366.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-3_load-1024x488.png 1024w\" width=\"1861\"/></a></p>\n<p>With this layout, I can now see all the price behaviour across all the periods in 1 single shot.</p>\n<p>Once you have this setup, then you can do a few cool things. For example, the crosshair is in sync here –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-4_ch.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5378\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"878\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1848px) 100vw, 1848px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-4_ch.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-4_ch.png 1848w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-4_ch-300x143.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-4_ch-768x365.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-4_ch-1024x487.png 1024w\" width=\"1848\"/></a></p>\n<p>So when you place the crosshair on a particular price point, it simultaneously appears across all the time frames. This helps you build a perspective on the price action panning out across these time frames.</p>\n<p>Out of the three charts, if you want to focus on any 1 particular chart, then click on the toggle button at the right bottom.

For example, the end of day chart may hint at a double top, if yes, I want to keep my shorts ready. However, this is at the end of day chart. So I can annotate just that chart. Click on the text options, and select a text box –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-6_text.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5380\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"855\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1911px) 100vw, 1911px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-6_text.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-6_text.png 1911w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-6_text-300x134.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-6_text-768x344.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-6_text-1024x458.png 1024w\" width=\"1911\"/></a></p>\n<p>Drop the text box to the time-period you want and scribble your notes –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-7_annotate.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5381\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"865\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1862px) 100vw, 1862px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-7_annotate.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-7_annotate.png 1862w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-7_annotate-300x139.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-7_annotate-768x357.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-7_annotate-1024x476.png 1024w\" width=\"1862\"/></a></p>\n<p>That’s with the multi-timeframe functionality, which, in my opinion, helps with intraday trades.</p>\n<h2><strong>21.2 Undo-Redo </strong></h2>\n<p>This one is a fun feature that I really like. Many times, I mess up the charts by placing trend lines and indicators that do not make sense, like this one –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-8_undo.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5382\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"843\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1860px) 100vw, 1860px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-8_undo.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-8_undo.png 1860w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-8_undo-300x136.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-8_undo-768x348.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-8_undo-1024x464.png 1024w\" width=\"1860\"/></a></p>\n<p>If you have to get rid of this, you’d be required to select the trend line and delete in most of the other platforms. In TV, you can do this with a click. Please note, the undo functionality undoes only the most recent action.</p>\n<h2><strong>21.3 Visibility</strong></h2>\n<p>This is another cool feature. The visibility settings help you visualize a certain drawing or a trend line only on a certain time period. Here is an example of Fibonacci retracement at the end of day chart –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-9_fib-retracement.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5383\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"864\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1903px) 100vw, 1903px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-9_fib-retracement.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-9_fib-retracement.png 1903w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-9_fib-retracement-300x136.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-9_fib-retracement-768x349.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-9_fib-retracement-1024x465.png 1024w\" width=\"1903\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now, I change this to an hourly chart, and I can still see the Fibonacci retracement –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-10_hr.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5384\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"878\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1854px) 100vw, 1854px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-10_hr.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-10_hr.png 1854w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-10_hr-300x142.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-10_hr-768x364.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-10_hr-1024x485.png 1024w\" width=\"1854\"/></a></p>\n<p>This can be a distraction as the study may not really be relevant to this particular time frame. TV has this feature wherein you can fix the study only to the relevant time frame, and when you change the time frame, the study would not appear.</p>\n<p>To do this, double click on the study and invoke the settings –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-11_vis.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5385\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"871\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1840px) 100vw, 1840px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-11_vis.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-11_vis.png 1840w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-11_vis-300x142.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-11_vis-768x364.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-11_vis-1024x485.png 1024w\" width=\"1840\"/></a></p>\n<p>Here, I’ve specified that the study should be visible only at the end of day chart. So when I change the frequency to any other, this study will not appear.</p>\n<h2><strong>21.4 Go-to date</strong></h2>\n<p>This one is really cool. How many times have you been in a situation where you would want to figure out how the stock price behaved on a certain date on a specific time. Let’s say, and I want to know what Infy did on 2<sup>nd</sup> Jan 2019, at 12:30 PM. To figure this, you usually have to scroll through the charts, and after few trial and error, you’d land upon the exact date. There is no such hassle with TV, as TV has a ‘Go-to’, feature. This feature is so powerful that it can take you to the exact candle, even on an intraday basis. This is available right at the bottom of the chart –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-12_goto.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5386\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"876\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1734px) 100vw, 1734px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-12_goto.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-12_goto.png 1734w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-12_goto-300x152.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-12_goto-768x388.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-12_goto-1024x517.png 1024w\" width=\"1734\"/></a></p>\n<p>Here, I’m looking at March 5<sup>th</sup>, 12:15 PM candle –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-13_gototime.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5387 size-large\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"759\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-13_gototime-1024x759.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-13_gototime-1024x759.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-13_gototime-300x222.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-13_gototime-768x569.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-13_gototime.png 1180w\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<h2><strong>21.5 HD images</strong></h2>\n<p>How many times, have you created a meaningful chart with tons of study on it. You want to share it with your friend over what apps or tweet it out, but you end up taking a screenshot of the chart, and that results in a rather ugly output. You can avoid this by taking high-quality images of the chart on TV.</p>\n<p>To get the image, all you need to do is click on ‘Alt + S’ –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-14_image.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5388\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"823\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1842px) 100vw, 1842px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-14_image.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-14_image.png 1842w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-14_image-300x134.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-14_image-768x343.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Image-14_image-1024x458.png 1024w\" width=\"1842\"/></a></p>\n<p>This will give you an option to either save the image or tweet it.</p>\n<p>I’ll keep this chapter open.

These two charting platforms are probably the most powerful charting engines to analyze charts. As a customer of Zerodha, you have access to both these platforms without having to pay for it.</p>\n<p>ChartIQ recently had an update, and with this update, there are many cool indicators and studies that you can use. Let me list a few –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Candlestick Patterns</li>\n<li>Stochastic RSI</li>\n<li>RSI divergence</li>\n<li>MACD divergence</li>\n<li>Stochastic divergence</li>\n<li>Central pivot range (CPR)</li>\n<li>Trade from chart</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I particularly find the candle pattern, CRP, and the trade from chart quite useful, hence this quick supplementary note to bring you up to speed.</p>\n<p>Ensure you have opted to look at charts from ChartIQ. You can do this by clicking on the profile section in Kite.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image0_ciq.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8495 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"168\" sizes=\"(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image0_ciq.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image0_ciq.png 762w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image0_ciq-300x66.png 300w\" width=\"762\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now, open any chart from your market watch –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-1_tfc.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8483 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"773\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1208px) 100vw, 1208px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-1_tfc.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-1_tfc.png 1208w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-1_tfc-300x192.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-1_tfc-1024x655.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-1_tfc-768x491.png 768w\" width=\"1208\"/></a></p>\n<p>On the top right, you can now see a Trade button.

For example, when I look at this Ashok Leyland chart, I know the stock is moving sideways from the last couple of trading sessions. I may consider a buy position if the stocks break out from the trading range.</p>\n<p>From the chart, I know the break out point is around 45 or thereabouts. All I have to do is click, drag the order window, and drop it in a place that I think is relevant on the chart. Once I do, I can place an order to either buy or sell. I can even choose between a delivery/CNC and MIS for intraday.</p>\n<p>In Ashok Leyland’s case, I want to be a buyer at around 45.40, a price I think is crucial for momentum to pick up.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-3_buy.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8485 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"712\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1269px) 100vw, 1269px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-3_buy.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-3_buy.png 1269w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-3_buy-300x168.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-3_buy-1024x575.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-3_buy-768x431.png 768w\" width=\"1269\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, I’ve dragged the order window up to 45.40, and I can fire an order within the charts without going back to the marketwatch and getting distracted with other quotes. The current market price, i.e. 42.45, is seen with the red background.</p>\n<p>Please use this feature; I think this is a great way to isolate yourself from the information clutter and focus purely on the price action.</p>\n<h2><strong>22.2 – Candlestick Pattern</strong></h2>\n<p>Candlestick pattern is an interesting addition in the recent update. The candlestick pattern study helps you identify the candlestick formation from the charts. The candlestick pattern identification is a great way to validate the patterns. However, I was hoping you could use this with some caution.</p>\n<p>To load a candlestick pattern, select the same from studies – <strong> </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-4_csp.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8486 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"777\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1219px) 100vw, 1219px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-4_csp.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-4_csp.png 1219w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-4_csp-300x191.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-4_csp-1024x653.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-4_csp-768x490.png 768w\" width=\"1219\"/></a></p>\n<p>Once you load from studies, you can see that the system automatically identifies the candlestick patterns.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-5_iden.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8488 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"525\" sizes=\"(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-5_iden.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-5_iden.png 902w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-5_iden-300x175.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-5_iden-768x447.png 768w\" width=\"902\"/></a></p>\n<p>ChartIQ identifies candlestick patterns on the chart. I’m looking at the EOD chart here, but you can do this on intraday charts as well.</p>\n<p>While this is a great way to validate the candlestick pattern, there is one problem with this. The identification process does not consider the ‘prior trend’, rule that is critical to candlestick pattern.</p>\n<p>For example, the three engulfing patterns are accurate, but one should not trade based on this, given the fact that the prior trend is missing. However, look at the hanging man pattern; this is one makes sense.</p>\n<p>So how should one use this?</p>\n<p>Well, I’d suggest you carry out your analysis as usual, and once you are convinced that there is a trading opportunity based on a candlestick pattern, then switch on the candlestick pattern studies and validate the pattern. The pattern you have in mind and the one ChartIQ should match.</p>\n<p>For example, here is the chart of DCB Bank.

CPR is beneficial for intraday trading.</p>\n<p>Before you understand the CPR, it is important for you to know the Support and Resistance; I’d suggest you read through this <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/support-resistance/\">chapter to know what more</a> about Support and Resistance before proceeding further.</p>\n<p>The CPR consists of three components –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pivot</li>\n<li>Bottom Central Pivot (BC)</li>\n<li>Top Central Pivot (TC)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are derived out of the underlying’s High, Low, and Close calculations –</p>\n<p>Pivot = (High + Low + Close)/3</p>\n<p>Bottom CPR = (High + Low)/ 2</p>\n<p>Top CPR = (Pivot – BC) + Pivot</p>\n<p>Spend a minute to understand the formula. These are simple averages and manipulation to the averages. In any technical indicator, the moment you see averages, you need to associate the indicator to the underlying trend.</p>\n<p>The CPR does just this, i.e. helps the trader identify key price points and the associated trend around these price points.</p>\n<p>Today’s CPR values act as the reference for tomorrow’s trading. We will get back to this in a bit.</p>\n<p>On Kite search for ‘Pivot’ in studies, and you’ll find the CPR indicator –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-8_cpr1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8491 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"738\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1212px) 100vw, 1212px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-8_cpr1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-8_cpr1.png 1212w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-8_cpr1-300x183.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-8_cpr1-1024x624.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-8_cpr1-768x468.png 768w\" width=\"1212\"/></a></p>\n<p>I’m looking 15-minute chart of M&amp;M here. Once you load the CPR, the CPR loads as three horizontal lines, as seen below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-9_cpr2.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8492 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"712\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1213px) 100vw, 1213px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-9_cpr2.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-9_cpr2.png 1213w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-9_cpr2-300x176.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-9_cpr2-1024x601.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-9_cpr2-768x451.png 768w\" width=\"1213\"/></a></p>\n<p>One thing that stands out is the varying width of the CPR. I’ve marked three points on the chart to discuss this.</p>\n<p>I want you to look at the first arrow starting from left, ignore the CPR but look at the price action itself. Remember this is the 15-minute chart, and it is quite clear that the day started with a small green candle with not much movement through the day. The open and close were close to each other.</p>\n<p>Whenever, we have a sideways movement, the next day’s CPR narrow ranged, this is exactly what we observe on the next day. Now the 2<sup>nd</sup> day itself was trending day. Hence the CPR for 3<sup>rd</sup> day was a wide-ranged one.</p>\n<p>So the point is –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If today is a narrow range day, tomorrow’s CPR will be a narrow ranged CPR.</li>\n<li>If today is a trending day, tomorrow’s CPR is a wide-ranged one. Higher the trend, wider is the CPR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alright, so how do we use the CPR? Well, this is quite straightforward –</p>\n<p><strong>Bullish outlook</strong>, look for buying opportunities when the current market price is higher than ‘Top central pivot’ (TC).</p>\n<p>Let me elaborate. Assume a stock has rallied for a bit. The current market price is higher than the TC, and you are looking for an opportunity to set up a buy trade.</p>\n<p>You can now wait till the stock arrests its rally and retraces back to the TC line.</p>\n<p>I’ve highlighted a possible opportunity here –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-10_pull-back.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8493 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"737\" sizes=\"(max-width: 899px) 100vw, 899px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-10_pull-back.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-10_pull-back.png 899w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-10_pull-back-300x246.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-10_pull-back-768x630.png 768w\" width=\"899\"/></a></p>\n<p>From a price action perspective, when the current market price is higher than the TC, it indicates that the traders are willing to buy even though the average price is higher.  Hence, it would help if you are looking for buying opportunities. Remember, when CMP is higher than TC, the TC now acts as a support line.</p>\n<p>Likewise, when the stock or the index is trading lesser than the “Bottom Central Pivot’ (BC). When the current market price is less than that BC, it implies that there is bearishness in the market, hence look for selling opportunities.</p>\n<p>Again, look for a price pull back to the BC line before initiating a fresh short.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-11_pullbackbear.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8494 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"680\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1198px) 100vw, 1198px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-11_pullbackbear.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-11_pullbackbear.png 1198w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-11_pullbackbear-300x170.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-11_pullbackbear-1024x581.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Image-11_pullbackbear-768x436.png 768w\" width=\"1198\"/></a></p>\n<p>You can even trade the stock while it is within the CPR. Trading while the stock price is within the CPR is like a range trade.</p>\n<p>You buy when the stock is at BC, with TC as a target and sell (fresh short) when the stock is at the TC with an expectation that the price declines to BC soon.</p>\n<p>Of course, I know many traders who prefer not to trade the range and prefer to trade only the pullbacks. I too would prefer to use CPR only to trade the pullbacks.</p>\n<p>Lastly, here is something that you need to be aware of when trading the CPR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you plot the EOD CPR, the previous month’s OHLC is referenced.</li>\n<li>Previous week’s OHLC is a reference when you plot CPR for 30mins and 1-hour candles.</li>\n<li>Previous day’s OHLC is referenced when you plot CPR for 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes candles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Happy trading.</p>\n<h3><strong>Key Takeaways from this chapter </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can trade from the chart by selecting the trade button.</li>\n<li>The trade button is a floating window which you can place anywhere on the chart.</li>\n<li>The candle pattern helps identify the candlestick patterns, use this to reconfirm the pattern.</li>\n<li>CPR helps you identify the S&amp;R pattern</li>\n<li>It is considered bullish if the current market price is higher than the TC line.</li>\n<li>It is considered bearish if the current market price below the BC line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

When an investor wishes to invest in a business for the long term (say 3 – 5 years), it becomes essential to understand the business from various perspectives. It is critical for an investor to separate the daily short term noise in the stock prices and concentrate on the underlying business performance. Over the long term, a fundamentally strong company’s stock prices tend to appreciate, thereby creating wealth for its investors.</p>\n<p>We have many such examples in the Indian market. To name a few, one can think of companies such as Infosys Limited, TCS Limited, Page Industries, Eicher Motors, Bosch India, Nestle India, TTK Prestige etc. Each of these companies has delivered an average over 20% compounded annual growth return (CAGR) year on year for over 10 years. At a 20% CAGR, the investor would double his money in roughly about 3.5 years to give you a perspective. Higher the CAGR faster is the wealth creation process. Some companies such as Bosch India Limited have delivered close to 30% CAGR. Therefore, you can imagine the magnitude and the speed at which wealth is created if one would invest in fundamentally strong companies.</p>\n<p>Here are long term charts of Bosch India, Eicher Motors, and TCS Limited that can set you thinking about long term wealth creation. Do remember these are just 3 examples amongst the many that you may find in Indian markets.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch1-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-909\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"241\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch1-chart1.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch1-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-910\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"198\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch1-chart2.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch1-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-911\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"261\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch1-chart3.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>At this point, you may think that I am biased as I am selectively posting charts that look impressive. You may wonder how the long term charts of companies such as Suzlon Energy, Reliance Power, and Sterling Biotech may look? Well here are the long term charts of these companies:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch1-chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-912\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"239\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch1-chart4.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch1-chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-913\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"248\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch1-chart5.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch1-chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-914\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"289\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch1-chart6.jpg\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>These are just 3 examples of the wealth destructors amongst the many you may find in the Indian Markets.</p>\n<p>The trick has always been to separate the investment-grade companies which create wealth from the companies that destroy wealth. All investment-grade companies have a few common attributes that set them apart. Likewise, all wealth destructors have a few common traits which are clearly visible to an astute investor.</p>\n<p>Fundamental Analysis is the technique that gives you the conviction to invest for a long term by helping you identify these attributes of wealth-creating companies.</p>\n<h2>1.2 – Can I be a fundamental analyst?</h2>\n<p>Of course, you can be. It is a common misconception that only chartered accountants and professionals from commerce background can be good fundamental analysts. This is not true at all. A fundamental analyst adds 2 and 2 to ensure it sums up to 4. To become a fundamental analyst, you will need a few basic skills:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Understanding the basic financial statements</li>\n<li>Understand businesses concerning the industry in which it operates</li>\n<li>Basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This module’s objective on Fundamental Analysis is to ensure that you gain the first two skill sets.</p>\n<h2>1.3 – I’m happy with Technical Analysis, so why bother about Fundamental Analysis?</h2>\n<p>Technical Analysis (TA) helps you garner quick short term returns. It helps you time the market for a better entry and exit. However, TA is not an effective approach to create wealth. Wealth is created only by making intelligent long term investments. However, both TA &amp; FA must coexist in your market strategy. To give you a perspective, let me reproduce the chart of Eicher Motors:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch1-chart7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-915\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"312\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch1-chart7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch1-chart7.jpg 930w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch1-chart7-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>Let us say a market participant identifies Eicher motors as a fundamentally strong stock to invest and therefore invests his money in the stock in 2006. You can see the stock made a relatively negligible move between 2006 and 2010. The real move in Eicher Motors started only from 2010. This also means FA based investment in Eicher Motors did not give the investor any meaningful return between 2006 and 2010. The market participant would have been better off taking short term trades during this time. Technical Analysis helps the investor in taking short term trading bets. Hence both TA &amp; FA should coexist as a part of your market strategy. In fact, this leads us to an important capital allocation strategy called “The Core Satellite Strategy”.</p>\n<p>Let us say, a market participant has a corpus of Rs.500,000/-. This corpus can be split into two unequal portions; for example, the split can be 60 – 40. The 60% of capital, Rs 300,000/- can be invested for a long term is fundamentally strong. This 60% of the investment makes up the core of the portfolio. One can expect the core portfolio to grow at least 12% to 15% CAGR year on year basis.</p>\n<p>The balance 40% of the amount, which is Rs.200,000/- can be utilized for active short term trading using Technical Analysis technique on equity, futures, and options. The Satellite portfolio can be expected to yield at least 10% to 12% absolute return every year.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Core\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-917\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"270\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Core1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Core1.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Core1-300x203.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<h2>1.4 – Tools of FA</h2>\n<p>The tools required for fundamental analysis are fundamental, most of which are available for free. Specifically, you would need the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The company’s annual report – All the information you need for FA is available in the annual report. You can download the annual report from the company’s website for free</li>\n<li>Industry-related data – You will need industry data to see how the company under consideration is performing concerning the industry. Basic data is available for free and is usually published in the industry’s association website</li>\n<li>Access to the news – Daily News helps you stay updated on the latest developments in the industry and the company you are interested in. A good business newspaper or services such as Google Alert can help you stay abreast of the latest news</li>\n<li>MS Excel – Although not free, MS Excel can be extremely helpful in fundamental calculations</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With just these four tools, one can develop a fundamental analysis that can rival institutional research. You can believe me when I say that you don’t need any other tool to do good fundamental research. In fact, even at the institutional level, the objective is to keep the research simple and logical.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Fundamental Analysis is used to make long term investments.</li>\n<li>Investment in a company with good fundamentals creates wealth.</li>\n<li>Using Fundamental Analysis, one can separate an investment-grade company from a junk company.</li>\n<li>All investment-grade companies exhibit a few common traits. Likewise, all junk companies exhibit common traits.</li>\n<li>Fundamental analysis helps the analysts identify these traits.</li>\n<li>Both Technical analysis and fundamental analysis should coexist as a part of your market strategy.</li>\n<li>To become a fundamental analyst, one does not require any special skill.

All three types of participation are different from one another. One has to take a stance on the type of market participant he would like to be. Having clarity on this can have a huge impact on his Profit &amp; Loss account.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch2-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-929\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"209\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch2-title1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch2-title1.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch2-title1-300x105.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>To help you get this clarity, let us consider a market scenario and identify how each market participant (speculator, trader, and investor) would react to it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>SCENARIO</strong></p>\n<p>RBI in the next two days is expected to convene to announce their latest stance on the monetary policy. Owing to the high and sticky inflation, RBI has hiked the interest rates during the previous 4 monetary policy reviews.  As we know, an increase in interest rates means tougher growth prospects for Corporate India – hence corporate earnings would take a hit.</p>\n<p>Assume there are three market participants – Sunil, Tarun, and Girish. Each of them views the above scenario differently and hence would take different actions in the market. Let us go through their thought process.</p>\n<p>(Please note: I will briefly speak about option contracts here, this is only for illustration purpose. We will understand more about derivatives in the subsequent modules)</p>\n<p><img alt=\"speculator\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-927\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"52\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/speculator.jpg\" width=\"108\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Sunil:</strong> He thinks through the situation, and his thought process is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He feels the interest rate are at an unsustainably high level.</li>\n<li>High-interest rates hamper the growth of corporate India.</li>\n<li>He also believes that RBI has hiked the interest rates to a record high level and it would be really tough for RBI to hike the rate again.</li>\n<li>He looks at what the popular analysts on TV are opinionating about the situation, and he is happy to note that his thoughts and the analyst thoughts are similar.</li>\n<li>He concludes that RBI is likely to cut the rates if not for keeping the interest rates flat.</li>\n<li>As an outcome, he expects the market to go up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To put his thoughts into action, he buys call options of State Bank of India. </strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"trader\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-930\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"52\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/trader.jpg\" width=\"108\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Tarun:</strong> He has a slightly different opinion about the situation. His thought process is as below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He feels expecting RBI to cut the rates is wishful thinking. In fact, he thinks that nobody can clearly predict what RBI is likely to do</li>\n<li>He also identifies that the volatility in the markets is high. Hence he believes that option contracts are trading at very high premiums.</li>\n<li>He knows from his previous experience (via backtesting) that the volatility is likely to drop drastically just after RBI makes its announcement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>To put his thoughts into action, he sells 5 lots of Nifty Call options and expects to square off the position just around the announcement time. </strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"investor\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-928\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"52\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/investor.jpg\" width=\"108\"/></p>\n<p><strong>Girish:</strong> He has a portfolio of 12 stocks which he has been holding for over 2 years. Though he is a keen observer of the economy, he has no view on what RBI is likely to do. He is also not worried about the policy’s outcome as he anyway plans to hold on to his shares for a long time. Hence with this perspective, he feels the monetary policy is another short-term passing tide in the market and will not have a major impact on his portfolio. Even if it does, he has both the time and patience to hold on to his shares.</p>\n<p>However, Girish plans to buy more of his portfolio shares if the market overreacts to the RBI news and his portfolio stocks fall steeply after the announcement is made.</p>\n<p>Now, what RBI will eventually decide and who makes money is not our concern. The point is to identify a speculator, a trader, and an investor based on their thought process. All three men seem to have a logic based on which they have taken a market action. Please note, Girish’s decision to do nothing itself is market action.</p>\n<p>Sunil seems to be highly certain on what RBI is likely to do, and therefore his market actions are oriented towards a rate cut. In reality, it is quite impossible to call a shot on what RBI (or for that matter any regulator) will do. These are complex matters and not straightforward to analyze. Betting on blind faith, without rational reasoning backing one’s decision is speculation. Sunil seems to have done just that.</p>\n<p>Tarun has arrived at what needs to be done based on a plan. If you are familiar with options, he is simply setting up a trade to take advantage of the high options premium. He clearly does not speculate on what RBI is likely to do as it does not matter to him. His view is simple – volatility is high; hence the premiums are attractive for an options seller. He is expecting the volatility to drop just before RBI decision.</p>\n<p>Is he speculating on the fact that the volatility will drop? Not really, because he seems to have backtested his strategy for similar scenarios in the past. A trader designs all his trades and not just speculates on an outcome.</p>\n<p>Girish, the investor, on the other hand, seems to be the least bit worked up on what RBI is expected to do. He sees this as a short term market noise which may not have any major impact on his portfolio. Even if it did have an impact, he believes that his portfolio will eventually recover from it. Time is the only luxury markets offer, and Girish is keen on leveraging this luxury to the maximum. In fact, he is even prepared to buy more of his portfolio stocks in case the market overreacts. His idea is to hold on to his positions for a long period of time and not get swayed by short term market movements.</p>\n<p>All the three of them have different mindsets which lead them to react differently to the same situation. This chapter’s focus is to understand why Girish, the investor has a long-term perspective and not really bothered about short-term movements in the market.</p>\n<h2>2.2 – The compounding effect</h2>\n<p>To appreciate why Girish decided to stay invested and not really react to short term market movement, one must understand how money compounds. Compounding in simple terms is the ability of money to grow when year 1 are reinvested for year 2.</p>\n<p>For example, consider investing Rs.100, which is expected to grow at 20% year on year (recall this is also called the CAGR). At the end of the first year, the money is expected to grow to Rs.120. At the end of year 1, you have two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Let Rs.20 in profits remain invested along with the original principal of Rs.100 or</li>\n<li>Withdraw the profits of Rs.20.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You decide not to withdraw Rs.20 profit; instead, you decide to reinvest the money for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year. At the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> year, Rs.120 grows to Rs.144. At the end of 3<sup>rd</sup> year, Rs.144 grows to Rs.173. So on and so forth.</p>\n<p>Compare this with withdrawing Rs.20 profits every year. Had you opted to withdraw Rs.20 every year than at the end of 3<sup>rd</sup> year the profits would have been just Rs. 60.</p>\n<p>However, since you decided to stay invested, the profits at the end of 3 years are Rs.173. A good Rs.13 or 21.7% over Rs.60 is generated because you opted to do nothing and decided to stay invested.  This is called the compounding effect.  Let us take this analysis a little further, have a look at the chart below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch2-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-932\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"244\" sizes=\"(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch2-Chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch2-Chart1.jpg 614w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch2-Chart1-300x119.jpg 300w\" width=\"614\"/></p>\n<p>The chart above shows how Rs.100 invested at 20% grows over a 10 year period. If you notice, it took almost 6 years for the money to grow from Rs.100 to Rs.300. However, the next Rs.300 was generated in only 4 years, i.e. from the 6th to 10th year.</p>\n<p>This is, in fact, the most interesting property of the compounding effect.  The longer you stay invested, the harder (and faster) the money works for you. This is exactly why Girish decided to stay invested – to exploit the luxury of time that the market offers.</p>\n<p>All investments made based on fundamental analysis require the investors to stay committed for the long term. The investor has to develop this mindset while he chooses to invest.</p>\n<h2>2.3 – Does invest work?</h2>\n<p>Think about a sapling – if you give it the right amount of water, manure, and care would it not grow? Of course, it will. Likewise, think about a good business with healthy sales, great margins, innovative products, and ethical management. Is it not obvious that the share price of such companies would appreciate? In some situations, the price appreciation may delay (recall the Eicher Motors chart from the previous chapter), but it will always appreciate it. This has happened over and over again across markets in the world, including India.</p>\n<p>An investment in a good company defined by <strong>investable grade attributes</strong> will always yield results. However, one has to develop an appetite to digest short term market volatility.</p>\n<h2>2.4 – Investible grade attributes? What does that mean?</h2>\n<p>Like we discussed briefly in the previous chapter, an investible grade company has a few distinguishable characteristics. These characteristics can be classified under two heads: the ‘Qualitative aspect’ and the ‘Quantitative aspects’. The process of evaluating a fundamentally strong company includes a study of both these aspects. In fact, I give the qualitative aspects a little more importance over the quantitative aspects of my personal investment practice.</p>\n<p><strong>The Qualitative aspect</strong> mainly involves understanding the non-numeric aspects of the business. This includes many factors, such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Management’s background</strong> – Who are they, their background, experience, education,  do they have the merit to run the business, any criminal cases against the promoters etc</li>\n<li><strong>Business ethics</strong> – is the management involved in scams, bribery, unfair business practices.</li>\n<li><strong>Corporate governance</strong> – Appointment of directors, organization structure, transparency etc</li>\n<li><strong>Minority shareholders</strong> – How does the management treat minority shareholders, do they consider their interest while taking corporate actions</li>\n<li><strong>Share transactions</strong> – Is the management buying/selling shares of the company through clandestine promoter groups.</li>\n<li><strong>Related party transactions</strong> – Is the company tendering financial favours to known entities such as promoter’s relatives, friends, vendors etc. at the cost of the shareholder’s funds?</li>\n<li><strong>Salaries paid to promoters</strong> – Is the management paying themselves a hefty salary, usually a percentage of profits.</li>\n<li><strong>Operator activity in stocks </strong>– Does the stock price display unusual price behaviour, especially when the promoter is transacting in the shares.</li>\n<li><strong>Shareholders </strong>– Who are the significant shareholders in the firm, who are the people with above 1% of the outstanding shares of the company</li>\n<li><strong>Political affiliation </strong>– Is the company or its promoters too close to a political party? Does the business require constant political support?</li>\n<li><strong>Promoter lifestyle – </strong>Are the promoters too flamboyant and loud about their lifestyle? Do they like to display their wealth?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A red flag is raised when any of the factors mentioned above do not fall in the right place. For example, if a company undertakes too many related party transactions, it would send favouritism and malpractice. This is not good in the long run. So even if the company has great profit margins, malpractice is not acceptable. It would only be a matter of time before the market discovers matters about ‘related party transactions’ and punishes the company by bringing the stock price lower. Hence an investor would be better off not investing in companies with great margins if such a company scores low on corporate governance.</p>\n<p>Qualitative aspects are not easy to uncover because these are very subtle matters. However, a diligent investor can easily figure this out by paying attention to the annual report, management interviews, news reports etc. As we proceed through this module, we will highlight various qualitative aspects.</p>\n<p><strong>The quantitative aspects</strong> are matters related to financial numbers. Some of the quantitative aspects are straightforward, while some of them are not. For example, cash held in inventory is straight forward; however, ‘inventory number of days’ is not. This is a metric that needs to be calculated. The stock markets pay a lot of attention to quantitative aspects. Quantitative aspects include many things, to name a few:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Profitability and its growth</li>\n<li>Margins and its growth</li>\n<li>Earnings and its growth</li>\n<li>Matters related to expenses</li>\n<li>Operating efficiency</li>\n<li>Pricing power</li>\n<li>Matters related to taxes</li>\n<li>Dividends payout</li>\n<li>Cash flow from various activities</li>\n<li>Debt – both short term and long term</li>\n<li>Working capital management</li>\n<li>Asset growth</li>\n<li>Investments</li>\n<li>Financial Ratios</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The list is virtually endless. In fact, each sector has different metrics. For example:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>For a retail Industry:</th>\n<th>For an Oil and Gas Industry:</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Total number of stores</li>\n<li>Average sales per store</li>\n<li>Total sales per square foot</li>\n<li>Merchandise margins</li>\n<li>Owned store to franchisee ratio</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td>\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Oil to Natural Gas revenue ratio</li>\n<li>Exploration costs</li>\n<li>Opening oil balance (inventory)</li>\n<li>Developed reserves</li>\n<li>Total production growth</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Over the next few chapters, we will understand how to read the basic financial statements, as published in the annual report. As you may know, the financial statement is the source for all the number-crunching required to analyse quantitative aspects.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The mindset of a trader and an investor is different.</li>\n<li>The investor has to develop an investment mindset if he is serious about investing.</li>\n<li>The investor should stay invested for a long period of time for the returns to compound.</li>\n<li>The speed at which the money doubles increases drastically the more time you stay invested. This is one of the properties of compounding.</li>\n<li>Every investment has to be evaluated on two aspects – qualitative &amp; quantitative.</li>\n<li>Qualitative aspects revolve around the non-numeric information related to the company.</li>\n<li>The quantitative aspects involve analyzing numeric data. The financial statements are an important source of finding quantitative data.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

The annual report is published by the end of the Financial Year, and all the data made available in the annual report is dated to 31<sup>st</sup> March. The AR is usually available on the company’s website (in the investor’s section) as a PDF document, or one can contact the company to get a hard copy of the same.</p>\n<p>Since the company’s annual report, whatever is mentioned in the AR is assumed to be official. Hence, any misrepresentation of facts in the annual report can be held against the company. To give you a perspective, AR contains the auditor’s certificates (signed, dated, and sealed) certifying the sanctity of the financial data included in the annual report.</p>\n<p>Potential investors and the present shareholders are the primary audiences for the annual report.  Annual reports should provide the most pertinent information to an investor and communicate its primary message. For an investor, the annual report must be the default option to seek information about a company. Of course, many media websites claim to give financial information about the company; however, the investors should avoid seeking information from such sources. Remember the information is more reliable if we get it to get it directly from the annual report.</p>\n<p>Why would the media website misrepresent the company information you may ask? Well, they may not do it deliberately, but they may be forced to do it due to other factors. For example, the company may like to include ‘depreciation’ in the expense side of P&amp;L, but the media website may like to include it under a separate header. While this would not impact the overall numbers, it does interrupt the overall sequencing of data.</p>\n<h2>3.2 – What to look for in an Annual Report?</h2>\n<p>The annual report has many sections that contain useful information about the company. One has to be careful while going through the annual report as there is a fragile line between the company’s facts and the marketing content that the company wants you to read.</p>\n<p>Let us briefly go through the various sections of an annual report and understand what the company is trying to communicate in the AR. For the sake of illustration, I have taken the Annual Report of Amara Raja Batteries Limited, belonging to Financial Year 2013-2014. As you may know, Amara Raja Batteries Limited manufactures automobile and industrial batteries. You can download ARBL’s FY2014 AR from here (<a href=\"https://www.amararajabatteries.com/Investors/annual-reports/\">https://www.amararajabatteries.com/Investors/annual-reports/</a>)</p>\n<p>Please remember, this chapter’s objective is to give you a brief orientation on how to read an annual report. Running through every page of an AR is not practical; however, I would like to share insights into how I would personally read through an AR and understand what kind of information is required and what information we can ignore.</p>\n<p>To better understand, I would urge you to download the Annual Report of ARBL and go through it simultaneously as we progress through this chapter.</p>\n<p>ARBL’s annual report contains the following 9 sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Financial Highlights</li>\n<li>The Management Statement</li>\n<li>Management Discussion &amp; Analysis</li>\n<li>10-year Financial highlights</li>\n<li>Corporate Information</li>\n<li>Director’s Report</li>\n<li>Report on Corporate governance</li>\n<li>Financial Section, and</li>\n<li>Notice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note, no two annual reports are the same; they are all made to suit the company’s requirement keeping in perspective the industry they operate in. However, some of the sections in the annual report are common across annual reports.</p>\n<p>The first section in ARBL’s AR is the <strong>Financial Highlights</strong>. Financial Highlights contains the bird’s eye view on how the company’s financials look for the year gone by. . The information in this section can be in the form of a table or a graphical display of data. This section of the annual report generally makes a multi-year comparison of the operating and business metrics.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot of the same:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Print\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-939\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"325\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart11.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart11-300x244.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>The details you see in the Financial Highlights section are basically an extract from its financial statement. Along with the extracts, the company can also include a few financial ratios calculated by the company itself. I briefly look through this section to get an overall idea, but I wouldn’t say I like to spend too much time on it. The reason for looking at this section briefly is that, I would anyway calculate these and many other ratios myself, and while I do so, I would gain greater clarity on the company and its numbers. Over the next few chapters, we will understand how to read and understand its financial statements and how to calculate the financial ratios.</p>\n<p>The next two sections, i.e. the ‘<strong>Management Statement</strong>’ and ‘<strong>Management Discussion &amp; Analysis</strong>’, are quite important. I spend time going through these sections. These sections give you a sense of what the company’s management has to say about their business and the industry in general. As an investor or a potential investor in the company, every word mentioned in these sections is important. In fact, some of the details related to the ‘Qualitative aspects’ (as discussed in chapter 2), can be found in these two sections of the AR.</p>\n<p>In the ‘Management Statement’ (sometimes called the Chairman’s Message), the investor gets a perspective of how the man sitting right on top is thinking about his business. The content here is usually broad-based and gives a sense of how the business is positioned. When I read through this section, I look at how realistic the management is. I am very keen to see if the company’s management has its feet on the ground. I also observe if they are transparent in discussing what went right and what went wrong.</p>\n<p>One example that I explicitly remember was reading through the chairman’s message of a well-established tea manufacturing company. In his message, the chairman was talking about revenue growth of nearly 10%. However, the historical revenue numbers suggested that the company’s revenue grew by 4-5%. Clearly, in this context, the growth rate of 10% seemed like a celestial move. This also indicated that the man on top might not really be in sync with ground reality, so I decided not to invest in the company. Retrospectively when I look back at my decision not to invest, it was probably the right decision.</p>\n<p>Here is Amara Raja Batteries Limited; I have highlighted a small part that I think is interesting. I would encourage you to read through the entire message in the Annual Report.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch3-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-938\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"465\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart2.jpg\" width=\"486\"/></p>\n<p>Moving ahead, the next section is the ‘<strong>Management Discussion &amp; Analysis</strong>’ or ‘MD&amp;A’. This, in my opinion, is perhaps one of the most important sections in the whole of AR. The most standard way for any company to start this section is by talking about the macro trends in the economy. They discuss the overall economic activity of the country and the business sentiment across the corporate world. If the company has high exposure to exports, they even talk about global economic and business sentiment.</p>\n<p>ARBL has both exports and domestic business interest; hence they discuss both these angles in their AR. See the snapshot below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch3-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-941\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"333\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart3.jpg\" width=\"364\"/></p>\n<p>ARBL’s view on the Indian economy:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch3-chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-942\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"331\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart4.jpg\" width=\"347\"/></p>\n<p>Following this, the companies usually talk about industry trends and what they expect for the year ahead. This is an important section as we can understand what the company perceives as threats and opportunities in the industry. Most importantly, I read through this and compare it with its peers to understand if the company has an advantage over its peers.</p>\n<p>For example, if Amara Raja Batteries Limited is a company of interest, I would read through this part of the AR and read through what Exide Batteries Limited has to say in their AR.</p>\n<p>Remember, until this point, the discussion in the Management Discussion &amp; Analysis is broad-based and generic (global economy, domestic economy, and industry trends). However, in the future, the company would discuss various aspects related to its business. It talks about how the business had performed across various divisions, how it fares compared to the previous year, etc. The company, in fact, gives out specific numbers in this section.</p>\n<p>Here is a snapshot of the same:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch3-chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-943\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"387\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart5.jpg\" width=\"428\"/></p>\n<p>Some companies even discuss their guidelines and strategies for the year ahead across the various verticals. Do have a look at the snapshot below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch3-chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-944\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"379\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart6.jpg\" width=\"392\"/></p>\n<p>After discussing these in ‘Management Discussion &amp; Analysis,’ the annual report includes a series of other reports such as – Human Resources report, R&amp;D report, Technology report etc. Each of these reports is important in the context of the industry the company operates in. For example, if I am reading through a manufacturing company annual report,  I would be particularly interested in the human resources report to understand if the company has any labour issues. If there are serious signs of labour issues, it could lead to the factory being shut down, which is not good for its shareholders.</p>\n<h2>3.3 – The Financial Statements</h2>\n<p>Finally, the last section of the AR contains the financial statements of the company. As you would agree, the financial statements are perhaps one of the most important aspects of an Annual Report. There are three financial statements that the company will present namely:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Profit and Loss statement</li>\n<li>The Balance Sheet and</li>\n<li>The Cash flow statement</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will understand each of these statements in detail over the next few chapters. However, it is important to understand that the financial statements come in two forms at this stage.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Standalone financial statement or simply standalone numbers and</li>\n<li>Consolidated financial statement or simply consolidated numbers</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To understand the difference between standalone and consolidated numbers, we need to understand a company’s structure.</p>\n<p>Typically, a well-established company has many subsidiaries. These companies also act as a holding company for several other well-established companies. To help you understand this better, I have taken the example of CRISIL Limited’s shareholding structure. You can find the same in CRISIL’s annual report. As you may know, CRISIL is an Indian company with a major focus on corporate credit rating services.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch3-chart7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-945\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"389\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart7.jpg\" width=\"559\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see in the above shareholding structure:</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Standard &amp; Poor’s (S&amp;P), a US-based rating agency holds a 51% stake in CRISIL. Hence S&amp;P is the ‘Holding company’ or the ‘Promoter’ of CRISIL.</li>\n<li>Public and other Financial institutions hold the balance of 49% of shares of CRISIL.</li>\n<li>However, S&amp;P itself is 100% subsidiary of another company called ‘The McGraw-Hill Companies’\n<ol type=\"i\">\n<li>This means McGraw Hill fully owns S&amp;P, and S&amp;P owns 51% of CRISIL.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Further, CRISIL itself fully owns (100% shareholding) another company called ‘Irevna’.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keeping the above in perspective, think about this hypothetical situation. Assume, for the financial year 2014, CRISIL makes a loss of Rs.1000 Crs and Irevna, its 100% subsidiary makes a profit of Rs.700 Crs. What do you would be the overall profitability of CRISIL?</p>\n<p>Well, this is quite simple – CRISIL on its own made a loss of Rs.1000 Crs, but its subsidiary Irevna made a profit of Rs.700 Crs, hence the overall P&amp;L of CRISIL is (Rs.1000 Crs) + Rs.700 Crs = (Rs.300 Crs).</p>\n<p>Thanks to its subsidiary, CRISIL’s loss is reduced to Rs.300 Crs instead of a massive loss of Rs.1000 Crs. Another way to look at it is that CRISIL on a <strong>standalone</strong> basis made a loss of Rs.1000 Crs, but on a <strong>consolidated</strong> basis, it made a loss of Rs.300 Crs.</p>\n<p>Hence, Standalone Financial statements represent the company’s standalone numbers/ financials and do not include its subsidiaries’ financials. However, the consolidated numbers include the companies (i.e.standalone financials)  and its subsidiaries financial statements.</p>\n<p>I personally prefer to look through the consolidated financial statements to represent the company’s financial position better.</p>\n<h2>3.4 – Schedules of Financial Statements</h2>\n<p>When the company reports its financial statements, they usually report the full statement and then follow it up with a detailed explanation.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the snapshot of one of ARBL’s financial statement (balance sheet):</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch3-chart8\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-946\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"319\" sizes=\"(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart8.jpg 603w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart8-300x159.jpg 300w\" width=\"603\"/></p>\n<p>Each particular in the financial statement is referred to as the line item. For example, the first line item in the Balance Sheet (under Equity and Liability) is the share capital (as pointed out by the green arrow). If you notice, there is a note number associated with share capital. These are called the ‘Schedules’ related to the financial statement. Looking into the above statement, ARBL states that the share capital stands at Rs.17.081 Crs (or Rs.170.81 Million). As an investor, I would obviously be interested in knowing how ARBL arrived at Rs.17.081 Crs as their share capital. To figure this out, one needs to look into the associated schedule (note number 2). Please look at the snapshot below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch3-chart9\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-947\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"168\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart9.jpg 597w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch3-chart9-300x115.jpg 300w\" width=\"439\"/></p>\n<p>Of course, considering you may be new to financial statements, jargon like share capital makes much sense. However, the financial statements are straightforward to understand, and over the next few chapters, you will understand how to read the financial statements and make sense of it. But for now, remember that the main financial statement gives you the summary and the associated schedules give the details about each line item.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Key takeaways from this chapter</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The Annual Report (AR) of a company is an official communication from the company to its investors and other stakeholders.</li>\n<li>The AR is the best source to get information about the company; hence AR should be the default choice for the investor to source company-related information.</li>\n<li>The AR contains many sections, with each section highlighting a certain aspect of the business.</li>\n<li>The AR is also the best source to get information related to the qualitative aspects of the company.</li>\n<li>The management discussion and analysis is one of the most important sections in the AR.

He is typically a person with an accounting background. His job involves preparing ledger entries, matching bills and receipts, tallying the inflows versus the outflows, auditing etc. The final objective is to prepare transparent financial statements that best represent the company’s true financial position. To prepare such a financial statement, certain skills are required. Usually, these skills are developed through the rigour of a Chartered Accountant’s training program.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the user just needs to be in a position to understand what the maker has prepared. He is just the user of the financial statements. He need not really know the details of the journal entries or the audit procedure. His main concern is to read what is being stated and use it to make his decisions.</p>\n<p>To put this in context, think about Google. Most of us do not understand Google’s complex search engine algorithm that runs in the backend. However, we all know how to use Google effectively. Such is the distinction between the maker and the user of financial statements.</p>\n<p>A common misconception amongst the market participants is that they believe the fundamental analyst needs to be thorough with financial statement preparation concepts. While knowing this certainly helps, it is not really required. To be a fundamental analyst, one needs to be the user and not the financial statement maker.</p>\n<p>There are three main financial statements that a company showcases to represent its performance.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Profit and Loss statement</li>\n<li>The Balance Sheet</li>\n<li>The Cash flow statement</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Over the next few chapters, we will understand each of these statements from the user’s perspective.</p>\n<h2>4.2 – The Profit and Loss statement</h2>\n<p>The Profit and Loss statement is also popularly referred to as the P&amp;L statement, Income Statement, Statement of Operations, and Statement of Earnings. The Profit and Loss statement shows what has transpired during a time period.  The P&amp;L statement reports information on:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The revenue of the company for the given period (yearly or quarterly)</li>\n<li>The expenses incurred to generate the revenues</li>\n<li>Tax and depreciation</li>\n<li>The earnings per share number</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From my experience, the financial statements are best understood by looking at the actual statement and figuring out the information. Hence, here is the P&amp;L statement of Amara Raja Batteries Limited (ARBL). Let us understand every line item.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch4-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-962\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"522\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch4-chart1.jpg\" width=\"541\"/></p>\n<h2>4.3 – The Top Line of the company (Revenue)</h2>\n<p>You may have heard analysts talk about the top line of a company. When they do so, they are referring to the revenue side of the P&amp;L statement. The revenue side is the first set of numbers the company presents in the P&amp;L.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch4-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-960\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch4-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch4-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch4-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>Before we start understanding the revenue side, let us notice a few things mentioned on the header of the P&amp;L statement:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch4-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-963\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"53\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch4-chart2.jpg\" width=\"552\"/></p>\n<p>The header clearly states:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The statement of P&amp;L for the year <strong>ending</strong> March 31, 2014, hence this is an annual statement and not a quarterly statement. Also, since it is as of March 31<sup>st</sup> 2014, it is evident that the statement is for the Financial Year 2013 – 2014 or it can be referred to as the FY14 numbers.</li>\n<li>All currency is denominated in Rupee Million. Note – 1 Million Rupees is equal to Ten Lakh Rupees. It is upto the company’s discretion to decide which unit they would prefer to express their numbers in</li>\n<li>The particulars show all the main headings of the statement. Any associated note to the particulars is present in the note section (also called the schedule). An associated number is assigned to the note (Note Number)</li>\n<li>By default, when companies report the numbers in the financial statement, they present the current year number on the left-most column and the previous year number to the right. In this case, the numbers are for FY14 (latest) and FY13 (previous)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first line item on the revenue side is called the <strong>Sale of Products</strong>.</p>\n<p>Since we know, we are dealing with a batteries company. Clearly, the sale of products means the Rupee value of all the battery sales the company has sold during FY14. The sales stand at Rs.38,041,270,000/- or about Rs.3,804 Crore.  The company sold batteries worth Rs.3,294 Cr in the previous financial year, i.e. FY13.</p>\n<p>Please note, I will restate all the numbers in Rupee Crore as I believe this is more intuitive to understand.</p>\n<p>The next line item is the excise duty. This is the amount (Rs.400 Crs) the company would pay to the government; hence, the revenue must be adjusted.</p>\n<p>The revenue adjusted after the excise duty is the <strong>net sales of the company</strong>. The net sales of ARBL are Rs.3403 Crs for FY14. The same was Rs.2943 Crs for FY13.</p>\n<p>Apart from the sale of products, the company also draws revenue from services. This could probably be in the form of annual battery maintenance. The revenue from the sale of services stands at Rs.30.9Crs for FY14.</p>\n<p>The company also includes “other operating revenues” at Rs.2.1crs.This could be revenues through the sale of products or services that is incidental to the company’s core operations.</p>\n<p>Finally, the revenue from Sale of products + Sale of services + Other operating revenues sums up to give the company’s <strong>total operating revenue</strong>. This is reported at Rs.3436 Crs for FY14 and Rs.2959Crs for FY13. Interesting, there is a note; numbered 17 associated with “Net Revenue from Operations” will help us inspect this aspect further.</p>\n<p>Do recall, in the previous chapter we had discussed notes and schedules of the financial statement.</p>\n<p>The following snapshot gives the details of note 17.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch4-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-964\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"311\" sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch4-chart3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch4-chart3.jpg 610w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch4-chart3-300x156.jpg 300w\" width=\"595\"/></p>\n<p>The notes clearly give a more detailed analysis of the split-up of <strong>revenues from operations</strong> (does not include other income details). As you can see under the particulars, section ‘a’ talks about the split up under sales of products.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sale of storage batteries in the form of finished goods for the year FY14 is Rs.3523 Crs versus Rs.3036 Crs in FY13.</li>\n<li>Sale of Storage batteries (stock in trade) is Rs.208 Crs in FY14 versus 149 Crs. Stock in trade refers to finished goods of previous financial year being sold in this financial year.</li>\n<li>Sale of home UPS (stock in goods) is at Rs.71 Crs in FY14 versus Rs.109 Crs FY13</li>\n<li>Net sales from sales of products adjusted for excise duty amounts to Rs.3403 Crs, matching the number reported in the P&amp;L statement.</li>\n<li>Likewise, you can notice the split up for revenue from services. The revenue number of Rs.30.9 tallies with the number reported in the P&amp;L statement</li>\n<li>In the note, the company says the “Sale of Process Scrap” generated revenue of Rs.2.1 Cr. Note that the sale of process scrap is incidental to the operations of the company, hence reported as ‘Other operating revenue”.</li>\n<li>Adding up all the revenue streams of the company, i.e. Rs.3403 Crs+ Rs.30.9 Crs +Rs.2.1 Crs gets us the Net revenue from operations = Rs.3436 Crs.</li>\n<li>You can also find similar split up for FY13</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you notice the P&amp;L statement, apart from net revenue from operations, ARBL also reports ‘Other Income’ of Rs.45.5 Crs. Note number 18 reproduced below explains what the other income is all about.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch4-chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-965\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch4-chart4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch4-chart4.jpg 594w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch4-chart4-300x157.jpg 300w\" width=\"574\"/></p>\n<p>As we can see, the other income includes income that is not related to the company’s main business. It includes interest on bank deposits, dividends, insurance claims, royalty income etc. Usually the other income forms (and it should) a small portion of the total income. A large ‘other income’ usually draws a red flag, demanding a further investigation.</p>\n<p>So adding up revenue from operations (Rs.3436 Crs) and other income (Rs.45 Crs), we have the total revenue for FY14 at Rs.3482Crs.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The financial statement provides information and conveys the financial position of the company.</li>\n<li>A complete set of financial statements include the Profit &amp; Loss Account, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement.</li>\n<li>A fundamental Analyst is a financial statement user, and he needs to know what the maker of the financial statements states.</li>\n<li>The profit and loss statement gives the profitability of the company for the year under consideration.</li>\n<li>The P&amp;L statement is an estimate, as the company can revise the numbers at a later point.

Moving further on the P&amp;L statement, in this chapter, we will look at the expense side of the Profit and Loss Statement along with the associated notes. Expenses are generally classified according to their function, which is also called the cost of sales method or based on the expense’s nature. An analysis of the expenses must be shown in the Profit and Loss statement or the notes. As you can see in the extract below, almost all the line items have a note associated with it.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch5-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-970\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"193\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch5-chart1.jpg\" width=\"587\"/></p>\n<p>The first line item on the expense side is ‘Cost of materials consumed’; this is invariably the raw material cost that the company requires to manufacture finished goods. As you can see, the cost of raw material consumed/raw material is the company’s largest expense. This expense stands at Rs.2101 Crs for the FY14 and Rs.1760 Crs for the FY13. Note number 19 gives the associated details for this expense; let us inspect the same.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch5-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-971\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"157\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch5-chart2.jpg\" width=\"597\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see, note 19 gives us the details of the material consumed. The company uses lead, lead alloys, separators and other items, all of which adds up to Rs.2101 Crs.</p>\n<p>The next two line items talk about ‘Purchases of Stock in Trade’ and ‘Change in Inventories of finished goods, work-in-process &amp; stock-in-trade’. Both these line items are associated with the same note (Note 20).</p>\n<p>Purchases of stock in the trade refer to all the purchases of finished goods that the company buys towards conducting its business. This stands at Rs.211 Crs. I will give you more clarity on this line item shortly.</p>\n<p>Change in the inventory of finished goods refers to the costs of manufacturing incurred by the company in the past, but the goods manufactured in the past were sold in the present/current financial year. This stands at (Rs.29.2) Crs for the FY14.</p>\n<p>A negative number indicates that the company produced more batteries in the FY14 than it managed to sell. To give a sense of proportion (in terms of sales and sales costs), the company deducts the cost incurred in manufacturing the extra goods from the current year costs. The company will add this cost when they manage to sell these extra products sometime in future. This cost, which the company adds back later, will be included in the “Purchases of Stock in Trade” line item.</p>\n<p>Here is an extract of Note 20 which details the above two line items:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch5-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-972\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"398\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch5-chart3.jpg\" width=\"524\"/></p>\n<p>The details mentioned in the above extract are quite straightforward and is easy to understand. At this stage, it may not be necessary to dig deeper into this note. It is good to know where the total lies. However, when we take up ‘Financial Modeling’ as a separate module, we will delve deeper into this aspect.</p>\n<p>The next line item on the expense side is “Employee Benefits Expense”. This is quite intuitive as it includes expense incurred in terms of the salaries paid, contribution towards provident funds, and other employee welfare expenses. This stands at Rs.158 Crs for the FY14. Have a look at the extract of note 21, which details the ‘Employee Benefits Expense’.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch5-chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-973\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"125\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch5-chart4.jpg\" width=\"588\"/></p>\n<p>Here is something for you to think about – A company generating Rs.3482 Crs is spending only Rs.158 Crs or just 4.5% of its sales on its employees. In fact, this is the pattern across most companies (at least non IT). Perhaps it is time for you to rethink about that entrepreneurial dream you may have nurtured.</p>\n<p>The next line item is the “Finance Cost / Finance Charges/ Borrowing Costs”. Finance cost is interest costs and other costs that an entity pays when it borrows funds. The interest is paid to the lenders of the company. The lenders could be banks or private lenders. The company’s finance cost stands at Rs.0.7 Crs for the FY14. We will discuss the debt and related matters more when we take up the chapter on the balance sheet later.</p>\n<p>Following the finance cost, the next line item is “Depreciation and Amortization” costs which stand at Rs.64.5 Crs. To understand depreciation and amortization, we need to understand the concept of tangible and intangible assets.</p>\n<p>A tangible asset has a physical form and provides an economic value to the company—for example, a laptop, a printer, a car, plants, machinery, buildings etc.</p>\n<p>An intangible asset does not have a physical form but still provides an economic value to the company such as brand value, trademarks, copyrights, patents, franchises, customer lists etc.</p>\n<p>An asset (tangible or intangible) has to be depreciated over its useful life. Useful life is defined as the period during which the asset can provide economic benefit to the company. For example, the useful life of a laptop could be 4 years. Let us understand depreciation better with the help of the following example.</p>\n<p>Zerodha, a stockbroking firm generates Rs.100,000/- from the stockbroking business. However, Zerodha incurred Rs.65,000/- towards the purchase of a high-performance computer server. The economic life (useful life) of the server is expected to be 5 years. Now if you were to look into the earning capability of Zerodha it appears that on the one hand, Zerodha earned Rs.100,000/- and on the other hand, spent Rs.65,000/- and therefore retained just Rs.35,000/-. This skews the earnings data for the current year and does not really reflect the company’s true earning capability.</p>\n<p>Remember the asset even though purchased this year, would continue to provide economic benefits over its useful life. Hence it makes sense to spread the cost of acquiring the asset over its useful life. This is called depreciation. This means instead of showing an upfront lump sum expense (towards the purchase of an asset), the company can show a smaller amount spread across the useful life of an asset.</p>\n<p>Thus Rs.65,000/- will be spread across the server’s useful life, which is 5. Hence 65,000/ 5 = Rs.13,000/- would be depreciated every year over the next five years. By depreciating the asset, we are spreading the upfront cost. Hence after the depreciation computation, Zerodha would now show its earnings as Rs.100,000 – Rs.13,000 = Rs.87,000/-.</p>\n<p>We can do a similar exercise for non-tangible assets. The depreciation equivalent for non-tangible assets is called amortization.</p>\n<p>Here is an important idea – Zerodha depreciates the cost of acquiring an asset over its useful life. However, there is an actual outflow of Rs.65,000/- paid towards the asset purchase in reality. But now, it seems like the P&amp;L is not capturing this outflow. As an analyst, how do we get a sense of the cash movement? The cash movement is captured in the cash flow statement, which we will understand in the later chapters.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot of Note 23, detailing the depreciation cost.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch5-chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-974\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"111\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch5-chart5.jpg\" width=\"588\"/>The last line item on the expense side is “other expenses” at Rs.434.6 Crs. This is a huge amount classified under ‘other expenses’. Hence it deserves a detailed inspection.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch5-chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-975\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"272\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch5-chart6.jpg\" width=\"589\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch5-chart7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-976\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"420\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch5-chart7.jpg\" width=\"588\"/></p>\n<p>From the note, it is quite clear that other expenses include manufacturing, selling, administrative and other expenses. The details are mentioned in the note. For example, Amara Raja Batteries Limited (ARBL) spent Rs.27.5 Crs on advertisements and promotional activities.</p>\n<p>Adding up all the expenses mentioned in the expense side of P&amp;L, it seems that Amara Raja Batteries has spent Rs.2941.6 Crs.</p>\n<h2>5.2 – The Profit before tax</h2>\n<p>It refers to the net operating income after deducting operating expenses but before deducting taxes and interest. Proceeding further on the P&amp;L statement, we can see that ARBL has mentioned their profit before tax and exceptional item numbers.</p>\n<p>Put the profit before tax (PBT) is:</p>\n<p>Profit before Tax = Total Revenues – Total Operating Expenses</p>\n<p>= Rs.3482 – Rs.2941.6</p>\n<p>=Rs.540.5</p>\n<p>However, there seems to be an exceptional item/ extraordinary item of Rs.3.8 Crs, which needs to be deducted. Exceptional items/ extraordinary items are expenses occurring at one odd time for the company, and the company does not foresee this as a recurring expense. Hence they treat it separately on the P&amp;L statement.</p>\n<p>Hence profit before tax and extraordinary items will be:</p>\n<p>= 540.5 – 3.88</p>\n<p><strong>= Rs.536.6 Crs</strong></p>\n<p>The snapshot below (extract from P&amp;L) shows the PBT(Profit Before Tax)  of ARBL:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch5-chart8\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-977\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"66\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch5-chart8.jpg\" width=\"586\"/></p>\n<h2>5.3 – Net Profit after tax</h2>\n<p>After-tax, the net operating profit is defined as its operating profit after deducting its tax liability. We are now looking into the last part of the P&amp;L statement, the profit after tax. This is also called the bottom line of the P&amp;L statement.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch5-chart9\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-978\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"123\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch5-chart9.jpg\" width=\"588\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see from the snapshot above, to arrive at the profit after tax (PAT), we need to deduct all the applicable tax expenses from the PBT. Current tax is the corporate tax applicable for the given year. This stands at Rs.158 Crs.  Besides this, there are other taxes that the company has paid. All taxes together total upto Rs.169.21 Crs. Deducting the tax amount from the PBT of Rs.536.6 gives us the profit after tax (PAT) at Rs.367.4 Crs.</p>\n<p>Hence Net <strong>PAT = PBT – Applicable taxes</strong>.</p>\n<p>The last line in the P&amp;L statement talks about basic and diluted earnings per share. The EPS is one of the most frequently used statistics in financial analysis. EPS also serves to assess the stewardship and management role performed by the company directors and managers. The earnings per share (EPS) is a very sacred number which indicates how much the company is earning per face value of the ordinary share. It appears that ARBL is earning Rs.21.51 per share. The detailed calculation is as shown below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch5-chart10\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-979\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"223\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch5-chart10.jpg\" width=\"588\"/></p>\n<p>The company indicates that 17,08,12,500 shares are outstanding in the market. Dividing the total profit after tax number by the outstanding number of shares, we can arrive at the earnings per share number. In this case:</p>\n<p>Rs.367.4 Crs divided by 17,08,12,500 yields Rs.21.5 per share.</p>\n<h2>5.4 – Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Now that we have gone through all the line items in the P&amp;L statement, let us relook at it in its entirety.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch5-chart11\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-980\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"519\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch5-chart11.jpg\" width=\"541\"/></p>\n<p>Hopefully, the statement above should look more meaningful to you by now. Remember, almost all line items in the P&amp;L statement will have an associated note. You can always look into the notes to seek greater clarity. Also, we have just understood how to read the P&amp;L statement at this stage, but we still need to analyze what the numbers mean. We will do this when we take up the financial ratios. The P&amp;L statement is also very closely connected with the other two financial statements, i.e. the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. We will explore these connections at a later stage.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Key takeaways from this chapter:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The P&amp;L statement’s expense statement contains information on all the expenses incurred by the company during the financial year.</li>\n<li>Each expense can be studied concerning a note which you can explore for further information.</li>\n<li>Depreciation and amortization is a way of spreading the cost of an asset over its useful life.</li>\n<li>The cost of interest and other charges paid when the company borrows money for its capital expenditure.</li>\n<li>PBT = Total Revenue – Total Expense – Exceptional items (if any)</li>\n<li>Net PAT = PBT – applicable taxes</li>\n<li>EPS reflects the earning capacity of a company on a per-share basis.

The P&amp;L statement, as you understood, discusses the profitability for the financial year under consideration. Hence it is good to say that the P&amp;L statement is standalone. However, the balance sheet is prepared on a flow basis, meaning, it has financial information about the company right from the time it was incorporated. Thus while the P&amp;L talks about how the company performed in a particular financial year; the balance sheet, on the other hand, discusses how the company has evolved financially over the years.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the balance sheet of Amara Raja Batteries Limited (ARBL):</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-997\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"524\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart1.jpg\" width=\"550\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see, the balance sheet contains details about the assets, liabilities, and equity.</p>\n<p>We had discussed assets in the previous chapter. <strong>Assets</strong>, both tangible and intangible, are owned by the company. An asset is a resource controlled by the company and is expected to have an economic value in the future. Typical examples of assets include plants, machinery, cash, brands, patents etc. Assets are of two types, current and non-current, we will discuss these later in the chapter.</p>\n<p><strong>Liability,</strong> on the other hand, represents the company’s obligation. The company takes up the obligation because it believes these obligations will provide economic value in the long run. Liability in simple words is the loan that the company has taken, and it is obligated to repay.  Typical examples of obligation include short term borrowing, long term borrowing, payments due etc. Liabilities are of two types, namely current and non-current. We will discuss the kinds of liabilities later on in the chapter.</p>\n<p>In any typical balance sheet, the company’s total assets should be equal to the company’s total liabilities. Hence,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\"><strong>Assets = Liabilities</strong></span></p>\n<p>The equation above is called the balance sheet equation or the accounting equation. In fact, this equation depicts the balance sheet’s key property, i.e. the balance sheet, should always be balanced. In other words, the Assets of the company should be equal to the Liabilities of the company. This is because everything that a company owns (Assets) has to be purchased either from either the owner’s capital or liabilities.</p>\n<p>Owners Capital is the difference between the Assets and Liabilities. It is also called the ‘Shareholders Equity’ or the ‘Net worth’. Representing this in the form of an equation :</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\"><strong>Shareholders equity = Assets – Liabilities</strong></span></p>\n<h2>6.2 –A quick note on shareholders’ funds</h2>\n<p>As we know, the balance sheet has two main sections, i.e. the assets and the liabilities. The liabilities, as you know, represent the obligation of the company. The shareholders’ fund, which is integral to the balance sheet’s liabilities side, is highlighted in the snapshot below. Many people find this term a little confusing.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-998\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"291\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart2.jpg\" width=\"571\"/></p>\n<p>On the one hand, if you think about it, we are discussing liabilities that represent the company’s obligation. On the other hand, we discuss the shareholders’ fund, which represents the shareholders’ wealth. This is quite counter-intuitive, isn’t it? How can liabilities and shareholders’ funds appear on the ‘Liabilities’ side of the balance sheet? After all the shareholder’s funds represent the funds belonging to its shareholders’ which in the true sense is an asset and not really a liability.</p>\n<p>To make sense of this, you should change how you look at a company’s financial statement. Think about the entire company as an individual, whose sole job is to run its core operation and create wealth for its shareholders’. By thinking this way, you are in fact separating the shareholders’ (which also includes its promoters) and the company. With this new perspective, now think about the financial statement. You will appreciate that the financial statements are a statement published by the company (which is an entity on its own) to communicate to the world about its financial well being.</p>\n<p>This also means the shareholders’ funds do not belong to the company as it rightfully belongs to its shareholders’. Hence from the company’s perspective, the shareholders’ funds are an obligation payable to shareholders’. Hence this is shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet.</p>\n<h2>6.3 –The liability side of the balance sheet</h2>\n<p>The liabilities side of the balance sheet details all the liabilities of the company. Within liabilities, there are three sub-sections – shareholders’ fund, non-current liabilities, and current liabilities. The first section is the shareholders’ funds.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-999\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"145\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart3.jpg\" width=\"550\"/></p>\n<p>To understand share capital, think about a fictional company issuing shares for the first time. Imagine, Company ABC issues 1000 shares, with each share having a face value of Rs.10 each. In this case, the share capital would be Rs.10 x 1000 = Rs.10,000/- (Face value X number of shares).</p>\n<p>In the case of ARBL, the share capital is Rs.17.081 Crs (as published in the Balance Sheet), and the Face Value is Rs.1/-. I got the FV value from the NSE’s website:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"337\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart4.jpg\" width=\"542\"/></p>\n<p>I can use the FV and share capital value to calculate the number of shares outstanding. We know:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 50px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Share Capital = FV * Number of shares</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 50px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Therefore,</span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 50px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Number of shares = Share Capital / FV</span></p>\n<p>Hence in case of ARBL,</p>\n<p>Number of shares = 17,08,10,000 / 1</p>\n<p><strong>= 17,08,10,000 shares</strong></p>\n<p>The next line item on the Balance Sheet’s liability side is the ‘Reserves and Surplus’. Reserves are usually money earmarked by the company for specific purposes. The surplus is where all the profits of the company reside. The reserves and surplus for ARBL stand at Rs.1,345.6 Crs. The reserves and surplus have an associated note, numbered 3. Let us look into the same.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1001\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"272\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart5.jpg 562w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart5-300x145.jpg 300w\" width=\"562\"/></p>\n<p>As you can notice from the note, the company has earmarked funds across three kinds of reserves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Capital reserves</strong> – Usually earmarked for long term projects. Clearly, ARBL does not have much amount here. This amount belongs to the shareholders, but cannot be distributed to them.</li>\n<li><strong>Securities premium reserve/account</strong> – This is where the premium over and above the shares’ face/par value sits. ARBL has an Rs.31.18 Crs under this reserve</li>\n<li><strong>General reserve</strong> – This is where all the company’s accumulated profits, which is not yet distributed to the shareholder, reside. The company can use the money here as a buffer. As you can see, ARBL has Rs.218.4 Crs in general reserves.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The next section deals with the surplus. As mentioned earlier, the surplus holds the profits made during the year. Couple of interesting things to note:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>As per the last year (FY13) balance sheet, the surplus was Rs.829.8Crs. This is what is stated as the opening line under a surplus. See the image below:</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1002\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"228\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart6.jpg\" width=\"522\"/></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The current year (FY14) profit of Rs.367.4 Crs is added to previous years closing balance of surplus. Few things to take note here:\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Notice how the bottom line of P&amp;L is interacting with the balance sheet. This highlights a significant fact – all three financial statements are closely related.</li>\n<li>Notice how the previous year balance sheet number is added up to this year’s number. This highlights that the balance sheet is prepared on a flow basis, adding the carrying forward numbers year on year.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Previous year’s balance plus this year’s profit adds up to Rs.1197.2 Crs. The company can choose to apportion this money for various purposes.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The first thing a company does is transfer some money from the surplus to general reserves so that it will come handy for future use. They have transferred close to Rs.36.7 Crs for this purpose.</li>\n<li>After transferring to general reserves, they have distributed Rs.55.1 Crs as dividends over which they have to pay Rs.9.3 Crs as dividend distribution taxes.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>After making the necessary apportions the company has Rs.1095.9 Crs as surplus as closing balance. This, as you may have guessed, will be the opening balance for next year’s (FY15) surplus account.</li>\n<li>Total Reserves and Surplus = Capital reserve + securities premium reserve + general reserves + surplus for the year. This stands at Rs.1345.6 Crs for the FY 14 against Rs.1042.7 Crs for the FY13</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The total shareholders’ fund is a sum of share capital and reserves &amp; surplus. Since this amount on the balance sheet’s liability side represents the money belonging to shareholders’, this is called the ‘shareholders funds’.</p>\n<h2>6.4 – Non-Current Liabilities</h2>\n<p>Non-current liabilities represent the long term obligations, which the company intends to settle/ pay off not within 365 days/ 12 months of the balance sheet date. These obligations stay on the books for a few years. Non-current liabilities are generally settled after 12 months after the reporting period.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot of the non-current liabilities of Amara Raja batteries Ltd.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"89\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart7.jpg 580w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart7-300x46.jpg 300w\" width=\"580\"/></p>\n<p>The company has three types of non-current liabilities; let us inspect each one of them.</p>\n<p><strong>The long term borrowing</strong> (associated with note 4) is the first line item within the non-current liabilities. Long term borrowing is one of the most important line items in the entire balance sheet as it represents the amount of money that the company has borrowed through various sources. Long term borrowing is also one of the key inputs while calculating some of the financial ratios. Subsequently, in this module, we will look into the financial ratios.</p>\n<p>Let us look into the note associated with ‘Long term borrowings’:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart8\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"257\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart8.jpg 592w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart8-300x130.jpg 300w\" width=\"592\"/></p>\n<p>From the note, it is quite clear that the ‘Long term borrowings’ is in the form of ‘interest-free sales tax deferment’. To understand what interest-free sales tax deferment really means, the company has explained the note below (I have highlighted the same in a red box). It appears to be some tax incentive from the state government. The company plans to settle this amount over a period of 14 years.</p>\n<p>You will find that there are many companies which do not have long term borrowings (debt). While it is good to know that the company has no debt, you must also question why there is no debt? Is it because the banks are refusing to lend to the company? Or is it because the company is not taking initiatives to expand its business operations. Of course, we will deal with the analysis part of the balance sheet later in the module.</p>\n<p>Do recollect; we looked at ‘Finance Cost’ as a line item when we looked at the P&amp;L statement. If the debt of the company is high, then the finance cost will also be high.</p>\n<p>The next line item within the non-current liability is ‘<strong>Deferred Tax Liability’</strong>. The deferred tax liability is basically a provision for future tax payments. The company foresees a situation where it may have to pay additional taxes in the future; hence they set aside some funds for this purpose. Why do you think the company would put itself in a situation where it has to pay more taxes for the current year at some point in the future?</p>\n<p>This happens because of the difference in the way depreciation is treated as per the Company’s act and Income tax. We will not get into this aspect as we will digress from our objective of becoming users of financial statements. But do remember, deferred tax liability arises due to the treatment of depreciation.</p>\n<p>The last line item within the non-current liability is the <strong>‘Long term provisions’</strong>. Long term provisions are usually money set aside for employee benefits such as gratuity; leave encashment, provident funds etc.</p>\n<h2>6.5 – Current liabilities</h2>\n<p>Current liabilities are a company’s obligations which are expected to be settled within 365 days (less than 1 year). The term ‘Current’ is used to indicate that the obligation will be settled soon, within a year. Going by that ‘non-current’ clearly means obligations that extend beyond 365 days.</p>\n<p>Think about this way – if you buy a mobile phone on EMI (via a credit card) you obviously plan to repay your credit card company within a few months. This becomes your ‘current liability’. However, if you buy an apartment by seeking a 15 year home loan from a housing finance company, it becomes your ‘non-current liability’.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot of ARBL’s current liabilities:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart9\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"83\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart9.jpg\" width=\"601\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see, there are 4 line items within the current liabilities. The first one is the short term borrowings. As the name suggests, these are short term obligations of the company usually undertaken by the company to meet day to day cash requirements (also called working capital requirements). Here is the extract of note 7, which details what short term borrowings mean:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart10\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"190\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart10.jpg 601w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart10-300x95.jpg 300w\" width=\"601\"/></p>\n<p>Clearly, as you can see, these are short-term loans available from the State bank of India and Andhra Bank towards meeting the working capital requirements. It is interesting to note that the short term borrowing is also kept at a low level, at just Rs.8.3Crs.</p>\n<p>The next line item is Trade Payable (also called account payable) at Rs.127.7 Crs. These are obligations payable to vendors who supply to the company. The vendors could be raw material suppliers, utility companies providing services, stationery companies etc. Have a look at note 8 which gives the details:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart11\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1007\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"204\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart11.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart11-300x102.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>The next line item says ‘Other current liabilities’ which stands at Rs.215.6 Crs. Usually ‘Other current Liabilities’ are obligations associated with the statutory requirements and obligations that are not directly related to the company’s operations. Here is note 9 associated with ‘Other current liabilities’:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart12\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"351\" sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart12.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart12.jpg 607w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart12-300x192.jpg 300w\" width=\"549\"/></p>\n<p>The last line item in current liabilities is the ‘Short term provisions’ which stands at Rs.281.8 Crs. Short term provisions are quite similar to long term provisions, which deals with setting aside funds for employee benefits such as gratuity, leave encashment, provident funds etc. Interestingly the note associated with ‘Short term Provisions’ and the ‘Long term provisions’ is the same. Have a look at the following:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart13\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"150\" sizes=\"(max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart13.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart13.jpg 586w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart13-300x77.jpg 300w\" width=\"586\"/></p>\n<p>Since note 6 is detailing both long and short term provisions, it runs into several pages; hence, for this reason, I will not represent an extract of it. Those who are curious to look into the same can refer to pages 80, 81, 82 and 83 in the FY14 Annual report for Amara Raja Batteries Limited.</p>\n<p>However, from the user of a financial statement perspective, all you need to know is that these line items (short and long term provisions) deal with the employee and related benefits. Please note, one should always look at the associated note to run through the details.</p>\n<p>We have now looked through half of the balance sheet, which is broadly classified as the Balance sheet’s Liabilities side. Let us relook at the balance sheet once again to get a perspective:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch6-Chart14\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"614\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch6-Chart14.jpg\" width=\"597\"/></p>\n<p>Clearly,</p>\n<p><strong>Total Liability = Shareholders’ Funds + Non Current Liabilities + Current Liabilities</strong></p>\n<p>= 1362.7 + 143.03 + <strong> </strong>633.7</p>\n<p><strong>Total Liability = Rs.2139.4 Cars</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Key takeaways from this chapter</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>A Balance sheet also called the Statement of Financial Position is prepared on a flow basis that depicts the company’s financial position at any given point in time.

We will now understand the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the balance sheet, i.e. the Asset side of the balance sheet. The Asset side shows us all the company’s assets (in different forms) right from its inception. Assets in simple terms are the resources held by a company, which help in generating the revenues. Here is the snapshot of the Assets side of the balance sheet:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1020\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"289\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart1.jpg\" width=\"587\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see, the Asset side has two main sections, i.e. Non-current assets and Current assets. Both these sections have several line items (with associated notes) included within. We will look into each one of these line items.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-title1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1014\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-title1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-title1.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-title1-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>7.2 – Non-current assets (Fixed Assets)</h2>\n<p>Similar to what we learnt in the previous chapter, non-current assets talk about the company’s assets, the economic benefit of which is enjoyed over a long period (beyond 365 days). Remember, an asset owned by a company is expected to give the company an economic benefit over its useful life.</p>\n<p>If you notice within the non-current assets, there is a subsection called “Fixed Assets” with many line items under it. Fixed assets are assets (both tangible and intangible) that the company owns, which cannot be converted to cash easily or which cannot be liquidated easily. Typical examples of fixed assets are land, plant and machinery, vehicles, building etc. Intangible assets are also considered fixed assets because they benefit companies over a long period of time. If you see, all the line items within fixed assets have a common note, numbered 10, which we will explore in great detail shortly.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot of fixed assets of Amara Raja Batteries Limited:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1021\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"89\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart2.jpg 580w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart2-300x46.jpg 300w\" width=\"575\"/></p>\n<p>The first line item ‘Tangible Assets’ is valued at Rs.619.8Crs. Tangible assets consist of assets which have a physical form. In other words, these assets can be seen or touched. This usually includes plant and machinery, vehicles, buildings, fixtures etc.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the next line item reports the value of Intangible assets valued at Rs.3.2 Crs. Intangible assets are assets which have an economic value but do not have a physical nature. This usually includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, designs etc.</p>\n<p>Remember, when we discussed the P&amp;L statement we discussed depreciation. Depreciation is a way of spreading the cost of acquiring the asset over its useful life. The value of the assets depletes over time, as the assets lose their production capacity due to obsolescence and physical wear and tear. This value is called the Depreciation expense, shown in the Profit and Loss Account and the Balance Sheet.</p>\n<p>All the assets should be depreciated over its useful life. Keeping this in perspective, when the company acquires an asset, it is called the ‘Gross Block’. Depreciation should be deducted from the Gross block, after which we can arrive at the ‘Net Block’.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\"><strong>Net Block = Gross Block –Accumulated Depreciation</strong></span></p>\n<p>Note, the term ‘Accumulated’ is used to indicate all the depreciation value since its incorporation.</p>\n<p>When we read tangible assets at Rs.619.8 Crs and Intangible assets at Rs.3.2 Crs, remember the company is reporting its Net block, which is Net of Accumulated depreciation. Have a look at Note 10, which is associated with fixed assets.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1022\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"329\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart3.jpg\" width=\"620\"/></p>\n<p>At the top of the note, you can see the Gross Block, Depreciation/amortization, and a Net block is highlighted. I have also highlighted two netblock numbers which tally with what was mentioned in the balance sheet.</p>\n<p>Let us look at a few more interesting aspects of this note. Notice under Tangible assets you can see the list of all the assets the company owns.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1023\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"287\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart4.jpg\" width=\"538\"/></p>\n<p>For example, the company has listed ‘Buildings’ as one of its tangible assets. I have highlighted this part:-</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1024\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"280\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart5.jpg\" width=\"518\"/></p>\n<p>As of 31<sup>st</sup> March 2013 (FY13), ARBL reported the building’s value at Rs.93.4 Crs. During the FY14 the company added Rs.85.8Crs worth of building, this amount is classified as ‘additions during the year’. Further, they also wound up 0.668 Crs worth of building; this amount is classified as ‘deductions during the year’. Hence the current year value of the building would be:</p>\n<p>Previous year’s value of building + addition during this year – deduction during the year</p>\n<p>93.4 + 85.8 – 0.668</p>\n<p>= 178.5Crs</p>\n<p>You can notice this number is highlighted in blue in the above image. Do remember this is the gross block of the building. One needs to deduct the accumulated depreciation from the gross block to arrive at the ‘Net Block’. In the snapshot below, I have highlighted the depreciation section belonging to the ‘Building’.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1025\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"329\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart6.jpg 733w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart6-300x158.jpg 300w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>As of 31<sup>st</sup> March 2013 (FY13), ARBL has depreciated Rs.17.2 Crs, to which they need to add Rs.2.8 Crs belonging to the year FY14, adjust 0.376 Crs as the deduction for the year. Thus, the Total Depreciation for the year is:-</p>\n<p>Previous year’s depreciation value + Current year’s depreciation – deduction for the year</p>\n<p>= 17.2 + 2.8 – 0.376</p>\n<p>Total Depreciation= Rs.19.736 Crs. This is highlighted in red in the image above.</p>\n<p>So, we have to build gross block at Rs.178.6 Crs and depreciation at Rs.19.73 Crs which gives us a netblock of Rs.158.8 Crs ( 178.6– 19.73). The same has been highlighted in the image below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1026\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"329\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart7.jpg 733w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart7-300x158.jpg 300w\" width=\"624\"/></p>\n<p>The same exercise is carried out for all the other tangible and intangible assets to arrive at the Total Net block number.</p>\n<p>The next two line items under the fixed assets are Capital work in progress (CWIP) and Intangible assets under development.</p>\n<p>CWIP includes building under construction, machinery under assembly etc. at the time of preparing the balance sheet. Hence it is aptly called the “Capital Work in Progress”. This amount is usually mentioned in the Net block section. CWIP is the work that is not yet complete but where capital expenditure has already been incurred. As we can see, ARBL has Rs.144.3 Crs under CWIP. Once the construction process is done, and the asset is put to use, the asset is moved to tangible assets (under fixed assets) from CWIP.</p>\n<p>The last line item is ‘Intangible assets under development’. This is similar to CWIP but for intangible assets. The work in the process could be patent filing, copyright filing, brand development etc. This is at a minuscule cost of 0.3 Crs for ARBL. All these costs are added to arrive at the total fixed cost of the company.</p>\n<h2>7.3 – Non-current assets (Other line items)</h2>\n<p>Besides the fixed assets under the non-current assets, there are other line items as well. Here is a snapshot of the same:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart8\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1027\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"51\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart8.jpg 575w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart8-300x27.jpg 300w\" width=\"570\"/></p>\n<p>Non-current investments are investments made by ARBL with a long term perspective. This stands at Rs.16.07 Crs. The investment could be anything – buying listed equity shares, minority stake in other companies, debentures, mutual funds etc. Here is the partial (as I could not fit the entire image) snapshot of Note 11. This should give you a perspective.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart9\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"398\" sizes=\"(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart9.jpg 611w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart9-300x262.jpg 300w\" width=\"456\"/></p>\n<p>The next line item is long term loans and advances which stand at Rs.56.7Crs. These are loans and advances given out by the company to other group companies, employees, suppliers, vendors etc.</p>\n<p>The last line item under the Non-current assets is ‘Other Non-current assets’ which is at Rs. 0.122 Crs. This includes other miscellaneous long term assets.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-title2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1017\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"252\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-title21.jpg\" width=\"298\"/></p>\n<h2>7.4 – Current assets</h2>\n<p>Current assets are assets that can be easily converted to cash, and the company foresees a situation of consuming these assets within 365 days. Current assets are the assets that a company uses to fund its day to day operations and ongoing expenses.</p>\n<p>The most common current assets are cash and cash equivalents, inventories, receivables, short term loans and advances and sundry debtors.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot of the current assets of ARBL:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart10\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1029\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"94\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart10.jpg 579w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart10-300x49.jpg 300w\" width=\"572\"/></p>\n<p>The first line item on the Current assets is Inventory which stands at Rs.335.0 Crs. Inventory includes all the finished goods manufactured by the company, raw materials in stock, goods that are manufactured incompletely etc. Inventories are goods at various stages of production and hence have not been sold. When any product is manufactured in a company, it goes through various raw material processes to work in progress to finished good. Snapshot of Note 14 associated with the inventory of the company is as shown below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart11\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1030\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"212\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart11.jpg 591w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart11-300x108.jpg 300w\" width=\"591\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see, a bulk of the inventory value comes from ‘Raw material’ and ‘Work-in-progress’.</p>\n<p>The next line item is ‘Trade Receivables’ also referred to as ‘Accounts Receivables’. This represents the amount of money that the company is expected to receive from its distributors, customers and other related parties. The trade receivable for ARBL stands at Rs.452.7 Crs.</p>\n<p>The next line item is the Cash and Cash equivalents, which are considered the most liquid assets found in any company’s Balance sheet. Cash comprises of cash on hand and cash on demand. Cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments with a maturity date of fewer than three months from its acquisition date. This stands at Rs.294.5 Crs. Note 16 associated with Cash and bank balances is as shown below. As you can see, the company has cash parked in various types of accounts.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart12\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"203\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart12.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart12.jpg 593w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart12-300x103.jpg 300w\" width=\"593\"/></p>\n<p>The next line item is short-term loans and advances that the company has tendered and is expected to be repaid to the company within 365 days. It includes various items such as advances to suppliers, loans to customers, loans to employees, advance tax payments (income tax, wealth tax) etc. This stands at Rs.211.9 Crs. Following this is the last line item on the Assets side and on the Balance sheet itself. This is the ‘Other current assets’ which are not considered important, hence termed ‘Other’. This stands at Rs.4.3 Crs.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the Total Assets of the company would now be:-</p>\n<p>Fixed Assets + Current Assets</p>\n<p>= Rs.840.831 Crs + Rs.1298.61 Crs</p>\n<p>= Rs. 2139.441 Crs, which is exactly equal to the liabilities of the company.</p>\n<p>With this, we have now run through the Balance sheet’s entire Assets side, and in fact the whole of Balance sheet itself. Let us relook at the balance sheet in its entirety:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart13\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"477\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart13.jpg\" width=\"460\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see in the above, the balance sheet equation holds for ARBL’s balance sheet,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\"><strong>Asset = Shareholders’ Funds + Liabilities</strong></span></p>\n<p>Do remember, over the last few chapters we have only inspected the balance sheet and the P&amp;L statements. However, we have not analyzed the data to infer if the numbers are good or bad. We will do the same when we look into the financial ratio analysis chapter.</p>\n<p>The next chapter will look into the last financial statement, which is the cash flow statement. However, before we conclude this chapter, we must look into the many ways the Balance sheet and the P&amp;L statement are interconnected.</p>\n<h2>7.5 – Connecting the P&amp;L and Balance Sheet</h2>\n<p>Let us now focus on the Balance Sheet and the P&amp;L statement and the multiple ways they are connected (or affect) to each other.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the following image:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch7-Chart14\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1041\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"171\" sizes=\"(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart141.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart141.jpg 458w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch7-Chart141-300x112.jpg 300w\" width=\"458\"/></p>\n<p>In the image above, we have the line items on a typical standard P&amp;L statement on the left-hand side. Corresponding to that on the right-hand side, we have some of the standard Balance Sheet items. From the previous chapters, you already know what each of these line items means. However, we will now understand how the P&amp;L and Balance Sheet line items are connected.</p>\n<p>To begin with, consider the <strong>Revenue from Sales</strong>. When a company makes a sale, it incurs expenses. For example, if the company undertakes an advertisement campaign to spread awareness about its products, the company has to <strong>spend cash</strong> on the campaign. The money spent tends to decrease the cash balance. If the company makes a sale on credit, the <strong>Receivables</strong> (Accounts Receivables) go higher.</p>\n<p><strong>Operating expenses</strong> include the purchase of raw material, finished goods and other similar expenses. When a company incurs these expenses, to manufacture goods, two things happen. If the purchase is on credit (which invariably is), then the <strong>Trade payables</strong> (accounts payable) go higher. Two, the <strong>Inventory</strong> level also gets affected. Whether the inventory value is high or low, depends on how much time the company needs to sell its products.</p>\n<p>When companies purchase Tangible assets or invest in Brand building exercises (Intangible assets), the company spreads the asset’s purchase value over the asset’s economic useful life. This tends to increase the <strong>depreciation</strong> mentioned in the Balance sheet. Do remember the Balance sheet is prepared on a flow basis. Hence the Depreciation in the balance sheet is accumulated year on year. Please note, Depreciation in the Balance sheet is referred to as the <strong>Accumulated depreciation.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Other income</strong> includes monies received in interest income, sale of subsidiary companies, rental income etc. Hence, when companies undertake <strong>investment</strong> activities, other incomes tend to get affected.</p>\n<p>When the company undertakes <strong>Debt</strong> (it could be short term or long term), the company obviously spends money towards financing the debt. The money that goes towards financing the debt is called the <strong>Finance Cost/Borrowing Cost</strong>. Hence, when debt increases the finance cost also increases and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Finally, as you may recall the <strong>Profit after tax (PAT)</strong> adds to the company’s surplus, which is a part of the <strong>Shareholders equity</strong>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The Assets side of the Balance sheet displays all the assets the company owns</li>\n<li>Assets are expected to give an economic benefit during its useful life.</li>\n<li>Assets are classified as Non-current and Current asset.</li>\n<li>The useful life of Non-current assets is expected to last beyond 365 days or 12 months.</li>\n<li>Current assets are expected to pay off within 365 days or 12 months.</li>\n<li>Assets inclusive of depreciation are called the ‘Gross Block.’</li>\n<li>Net Block = Gross Block – Accumulated Depreciation</li>\n<li>The sum of all assets should equal the sum of all liabilities.

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>8.1 – Overview</h2>\n<p>The Cash flow statement is a significant financial statement, as it reveals how much cash the company is actually generating. Is this information not revealed in the P&amp;L statement you may think? Well, the answer is both a yes and a no.</p>\n<p>Consider the following scenario.</p>\n<p>Assume a simple coffee shop selling coffee and short eats. All the shop’s sales are mostly on a cash basis, meaning if a customer wants to have a cup of coffee and a snack, he needs to have enough money to buy what he wants. On a particular day, assume the shop manages to sell Rs.2,500/- worth of coffee and Rs.3,000/- worth of snacks. The shop’s income is Rs.5,500/- for that day. Rs.5,500/- is reported as revenues in P&amp;L, and there is no ambiguity with this.</p>\n<p>Now think about another business that sells laptops. For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that the shop sells only 1 type of laptop at a standard fixed rate of Rs.25,000/- per laptop. Assume on a certain day; the shop manages to sell 20 such laptops. Clearly the revenue for the shop would be Rs.25,000 x 20 = Rs.500,000/-. But what if 5 of the 20 laptops were sold on credit? A credit sale is when the customer takes the product today but pays the cash at a later point in time. In this situation here is how the numbers would look:</p>\n<p>Cash sale: 15 * 25000 = Rs.375,000/-</p>\n<p>Credit sale: 5 * 25000 = Rs.125,000/-</p>\n<p>Total sales: Rs.500,000/-</p>\n<p>If this shop were to show its total revenue in its P&amp;L statement, you would see revenue of Rs.500,000/- which may seem good on the face of it. However, how much of this Rs.500,000/- is actually present in the company’s bank account is not clear. What if this company had a loan of Rs.400,000/- that had to be repaid urgently? Even though the company has a sale of Rs.500,000, it has only Rs.375,000/- in its account. This means the company has a cash crunch, as it cannot meet its debt obligations.</p>\n<p>The cash flow statement captures this information. A statement of cash flows should be presented as an integral part of an entity’s financial statements. Hence in this context evaluation of the cash flow statement is highly critical as it reveals, amongst other things, the true cash position of the company.</p>\n<p>To sum up, every company’s financial performance is not so much dependent on the profits earned during a period, but more realistically on liquidity or cash flows.<br/>\n<img alt=\"M3-Ch8-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1073\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"240\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-title-300x120.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>8.2 – Activities of a company</h2>\n<p>Before we understand the cash flow statement, it is important to understand ‘the activities’ of a company. If you think about a company and the various business activities, you will realize that the company’s activities can be classified under one of the three standard baskets. We will understand this in terms of an example.</p>\n<p>Imagine a business, maybe a very well established fitness centre (Talwalkars, Gold’s Gym etc.) with a sound corporate structure. What are the typical business activities you think a fitness centre would have? Let me go ahead and list a few business activities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Display advertisements to attract new customers</li>\n<li>Hire fitness instructors to help clients in their fitness workout</li>\n<li>Buy new fitness types of equipment to replace worn-out equipment.</li>\n<li>Seek short term loan from bankers</li>\n<li>Issue a certificate of deposit for raising funds</li>\n<li>Issue new shares to a few known friends to raise fresh capital for expansion (also called preferential allotment)</li>\n<li>Invest in a startup company working towards innovative fitness regimes</li>\n<li>Park excess money (if any) in fixed deposits</li>\n<li>Invest in a building coming up in the neighbourhood, for opening a new fitness centre sometime in the future</li>\n<li>Upgrade the sound system for a better workout experience</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can see, the above-listed business activities are quite diverse; however, they are all related to the business. We can classify these activities as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Operational activities (OA):</strong> Activities related to the daily core business operations are called operational activities. Typical operating activities include sales, marketing, manufacturing, technology upgrade, resource hiring etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Investing activities (IA):</strong> Activities about investments that the company makes intending to reap benefits at a later stage. Examples include parking money in interest-bearing instruments, investing in equity shares, investing in land, property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other non-current assets etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Financing activities (FA):</strong> Activities about all financial transactions of the company such as distributing dividends, paying interest to service debt, raising fresh debt, issuing corporate bonds etc</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All activities a legitimate company performs can be classified under one of the above three mentioned categories.</p>\n<p>Keeping the above three activities in perspective, we will now classify each of the above-mentioned activities into three categories /baskets.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Display advertisements to attract new customers – <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #eacf32;\">OA</span></strong></li>\n<li>Hire fitness instructors to help customers with their fitness workout – <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #eacf32;\">OA</span></strong></li>\n<li>Buy new fitness equipment to replace worn-out equipment – <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #eacf32;\">OA.</span></strong></li>\n<li>Seek a short term loan from bankers – <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #ff6555;\">FA</span></strong></li>\n<li>Issue a certificate of deposit (CD) for raising funds – <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #ff6555;\">FA</span></strong></li>\n<li>Issue new shares to few known friends to raise fresh capital for expansion (also called preferential allotment) – <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #ff6555;\">FA</span></strong></li>\n<li>Invest in a startup company working towards innovative fitness regimes – <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #64b2ff;\">IA</span></strong></li>\n<li>Park excess money (if any) in fixed deposit – <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #64b2ff;\">IA</span></strong></li>\n<li>Invest in a building coming up in the neighbourhood for opening a new fitness centre sometime in the future – <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #64b2ff;\">IA</span></strong></li>\n<li>Upgrade the sound system for better workout experience- <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #eacf32;\">OA</span></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now think about the cash moving in and out of the company and its impact on the cash balance. Each activity that the company undertakes has an impact on cash. For example “Upgrade the sound system for a better workout experience” means the company has to pay money towards purchasing a new sound system. Hence the cash balance decreases. It is also interesting to note that the new sound system itself will be treated as a company asset.</p>\n<p>Keeping this in perspective, we will now understand for the example given above how the various activities listed would impact the cash balance and how would it impact the balance sheet.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Activity No</th>\n<th>Activity Type</th>\n<th>Rational</th>\n<th>Cash Balance</th>\n<th>On Balance Sheet</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>OA</td>\n<td>Expenditure on advertisement</td>\n<td><strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #ff6555;\">Decreases</span></strong></td>\n<td>Treated as an <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #69c969;\">asset</span></strong> as it increases the brand value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>OA</td>\n<td>Expenditure towards recruits</td>\n<td><strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #ff6555;\">Decreases</span></strong></td>\n<td>Treated as an <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #69c969;\">asset</span></strong> as it increases the company’s intellectual capital</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>OA</td>\n<td>Expenditure on new equipment</td>\n<td><strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #ff6555;\">Decreases</span></strong></td>\n<td>Treated as <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #69c969;\">asset</span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>FA</td>\n<td>Loan means cash inflow to business</td>\n<td><strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #64b2ff;\">Increases</span></strong></td>\n<td>The loan is a <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #c688fc;\">liability</span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>FA</td>\n<td>Deposits via CD means cash inflow</td>\n<td><strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #64b2ff;\">Increases</span></strong></td>\n<td>CD is a <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #c688fc;\">liability</span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td>FA</td>\n<td>Issue of fresh capital means cash inflow</td>\n<td><strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #64b2ff;\">Increases</span></strong></td>\n<td>Treated as a <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #c688fc;\">liability</span></strong> as share capital increases</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td>IA</td>\n<td>Investment in a startup means cash outflow</td>\n<td><strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #ff6555;\">Decreases</span></strong></td>\n<td>Investment is an <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #69c969;\">asset</span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td>IA</td>\n<td>Money parked in FD means cash going out of business</td>\n<td><strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #ff6555;\">Decreases</span></strong></td>\n<td>Equivalent to cash, hence considered an <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #69c969;\">asset</span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td>IA</td>\n<td>Investment in the building means cash going out of business</td>\n<td><strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #ff6555;\">Decreases</span></strong></td>\n<td>Gross block considered an <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #69c969;\">asset</span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>OA</td>\n<td>Expenditure towards the sound system</td>\n<td><strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #ff6555;\">Decreases</span></strong></td>\n<td>Treated as an <strong><span style=\"color: white; background-color: #69c969;\">asset</span></strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The table above is colour coded:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increase in cash is colour coded in blue</li>\n<li>The decrease in cash is colour coded in red</li>\n<li>Assets are colour coded in green and</li>\n<li>Liabilities are colour coded in purple.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you look through the table and start correlating the ‘Cash Balance’ and ‘Asset/Liability’ you will observe that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Whenever the liabilities of the company increases, the cash balance also increases.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>This means if the liabilities decreases, the cash balance also decreases.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Whenever the asset of the company increases, the cash balance decreases.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>This means if the assets decreases, the cash balance increases.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The above conclusion is the key concept while constructing a cash flow statement. Also, extending this further, you will realize that each company’s activity is its operating activity, financing activity, or investing activity either produces cash  (net increase in cash) or reduces (net decrease in cash)the cash for the company.</p>\n<p>Hence the total cash flow for the company will be:-</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Cash Flow of the company = Net cash flow from operating activities + Net Cash flow from investing activities + Net cash flow from financing activities</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>8.3 – The Cash Flow Statement</h2>\n<p>Having some insight into the cash flow statement, you would now appreciate that you need to look into the cash flow statement to review the company from a cash perspective.</p>\n<p>Typically when companies present their cash flow statement, they split the statement into three segments to explicitly show how much cash the company has generated across the three business activities. Continuing with our example from the earlier chapters, here is the cash flow statement of Amara Raja Batteries Limited (ARBL):</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch8-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1074\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"548\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart1.jpg 601w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart1-300x274.jpg 300w\" width=\"601\"/></p>\n<p>I will skip going through each line item, as most of them are self-explanatory. However, please notice that ARBL has generated Rs.278.7 Crs from operating activities. Note, a company with a positive cash flow from operating activities is always a sign of financial well being.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot of ARBL’s cash flow from investing activities:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch8-Chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1075\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"156\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart2.jpg 592w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart2-300x79.jpg 300w\" width=\"592\"/></p>\n<p>As you can see, ARBL has consumed Rs.344.8 Crs in its investing activities. This is quite intuitive as investing activities tend to consume cash. Also, remember healthy investing activities foretells the investor that the company is serious about its business expansion. Of course, how much is considered healthy and how much is not, is something we will understand as we proceed through this module.</p>\n<p>Finally, here is the snapshot of ARBL’s cash balance from financing activities:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch8-Chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1076\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"153\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart3.jpg 593w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart3-300x77.jpg 300w\" width=\"593\"/></p>\n<p>ARBL consumed Rs.53.1Crs through its financing activities. If you notice the bulk of the money went in paying dividends. <strong>Also, if ARBL takes on new debt in the future, it would increase the cash balance</strong> (remember the increase in liabilities, increases cash balance). We know from the balance sheet that ARBL did not undertake any new debt.</p>\n<p>Let us summarize the cash flow from all the activities:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Cash Flow from</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Rupees Crores (2013-14)</th>\n<th>Rupees Crores (2012-13)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Operating Activities</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">278.7</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">335.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Investing Activities</td>\n<td style=\"color: red; text-align: center;\">(344.8)</td>\n<td style=\"color: red; text-align: center;\">(120.05)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Financing Activities</td>\n<td style=\"color: red; text-align: center;\">(53.1)</td>\n<td style=\"color: red; text-align: center;\">(34.96)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Total</th>\n<th style=\"color: red;\">(119.19)</th>\n<th style=\"color: red;\">179.986</th>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This means the company consumed total cash of Rs.119.19 Crs for the financial year 2013 -2014. Fair enough, but what about the cash from the previous year? As we can see, the company generated Rs.179.986 Crs through all its activities from the previous year. Here is an extract from ARBL’s cash flow statement:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch8-Chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1077\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"82\" sizes=\"(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart4.jpg 584w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart4-300x42.jpg 300w\" width=\"584\"/></p>\n<p>Look at the section highlighted in green (for the year 2013-14). It says the opening balance for the year is Rs.409.46Crs. How did they get this? Well, this happens to be the closing balance for the previous year (refer to the arrow marks). Add to this the current year’s cash equivalents (Rs.119.19) Crs along with a minor forex exchange difference of Rs.2.58 Crs we get the company’s total cash position which is Rs.292.86 Crs. This means, while the company guzzled cash every year, they still have adequate cash, thanks to the previous year’s carry forward.</p>\n<p>Note, the closing balance of 2013-14 will now be the opening balance for the FY 2014 – 15. You can watch out for this when ARBL provides its cash flow numbers for the year ended 31<sup>st</sup> March 2015.</p>\n<p>At this point, let us run through a few interesting questions and answers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What does Rs.292.86 Crs actually state?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>This literally shows how much cash ARBL has in its various bank accounts.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>What is cash?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Obviously, this is a liquid asset of the company.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>What are liquid assets?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Liquid assets are assets that can be easily converted to cash or cash equivalents.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Are liquid assets similar to ‘current items’ that we looked at in the Balance sheet?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Yes, you can think of it that way.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If cash is current and cash is an asset, shouldn’t it reflect under the Balance sheet’s current asset?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Exactly and here it is. Look at the balance sheet extract below.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch8-Chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1072\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"220\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart5.jpg 591w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch8-Chart5-300x139.jpg 300w\" width=\"474\"/></p>\n<p>Clearly, we can now infer that the cash flow statement and the balance sheet interact with each other. This is in line with what we had discussed earlier, i.e. all the three financial statements are interconnected.</p>\n<h2>8.4 – A brief on the financial statements</h2>\n<p>Over the last few chapters, we have discussed the company’s three important financial statements, i.e. the P&amp;L statement, the Balance Sheet and the Cash Flow statement of the company. While the Cash flow and P&amp;L statement are prepared on a standalone basis (representing the given year’s financial position), the Balance Sheet is prepared on a flow basis.</p>\n<p>The P&amp;L statement discusses how much the company earned as revenues versus how much the company expanded in terms of expenses. The company’s retained earnings, also called the surplus of the company, are carried forward to the balance sheet. The P&amp;L also incorporates the depreciation number. The depreciation mentioned in the P&amp;L statement is carried forward to the balance sheet.</p>\n<p>The Balance Sheet details the company’s assets and liabilities. On the liabilities side of the Balance sheet, the company represents the shareholders’ funds. The assets should always be equal to the liabilities; only then do we say the balance sheet has balanced. One of the key details on the balance sheet is the cash and cash equivalents of the firm. This number tells us how much money the company has in its bank account. This number comes from the cash flow statement.</p>\n<p>The cash flow statement provides information to the users of the financial statements about the entity’s ability to generate cash and cash equivalents and indicates the cash needs of a company. Cash flows are prepared on a historical basis providing information about the cash and cash equivalents, classifying cash flows in to operating, financing and investing activities. The final number of cash flow tells us how much money the company has in its bank account.</p>\n<p>We have so far looked into how to read the financial statements and what to expect from each of them. We have not yet ventured into how to analyze these numbers. One of the ways to analyze the financial numbers is by calculating a few important financial ratios. In fact, we will focus on the financial ratios in the next few chapters.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The Cash flow statement gives us a picture of the true cash position of the company.</li>\n<li>A legitimate company has three main activities – operating activities, investing activities and the financing activities.</li>\n<li>Each activity either generates or drains money for the company.</li>\n<li>The company’s net cash flow is the sum of operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.</li>\n<li>Investors should specifically look at the cash flow from operating activities of the company.</li>\n<li>When the liabilities increase, cash level increases and vice versa</li>\n<li>When the assets increase, cash level decreases and vice versa.</li>\n<li>The net cash flow number for the year is also reflected in the balance sheet.</li>\n<li>The Statement of Cash flow is a useful addition to a company’s financial statements because it indicates the company’s performance.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>9.1 – A note on Financial Ratios</h2>\n<p>Over the last few chapters, we have understood how to read financial statements. We will now focus our attention on analyzing these financial statements. The best way to analyze the financial statements is by studying the ‘Financial Ratios’. The theory of financial ratios was made popular by Benjamin Graham, who is popularly known as the fundamental analysis father. Financial ratios help interpret the results and compare with previous years and other companies in the same industry.</p>\n<p>A typical financial ratio utilizes data from the financial statement to compute its value. Before we start understanding the financial ratios, we need to be aware of certain financial ratios’ attributes.</p>\n<p>On its own merit, the financial ratio of a company conveys very little information. For instance, assume Ultratech Cements Limited has a profit margin of 15%, how useful do you think this information is? Well, not much, really. 15% profit margin is good, but how would I know if it is the best?</p>\n<p>However, assume you figure out ACC Cement’s profit margin is 12%. Now, as we are comparing two similar companies, comparing the profitability makes sense. Clearly, Ultratech Cements Limited seems to be a more profitable company between the two. I am trying to drive across that more often than not, Financial Ratios on its own is quite mute. The ratio makes sense only when you compare the ratio with another company of a similar size or when you look into the financial ratio trend. This means that once the ratio is computed, the ratio must be analyzed (either by comparison or tracking the ratio’s historical trend) to get the best possible inference.</p>\n<p>Also, here is something that you need to be aware off while computing ratios. Accounting policies may vary across companies and different financial years. A fundamental analyst should be cognizant of this fact and adjust the data accordingly before computing the financial ratio.</p>\n<h2>9.2 – Financial Ratios</h2>\n<p>Financial ratios can be ‘somewhat loosely’ classified into different categories, namely –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Profitability Ratios</li>\n<li>Leverage Ratios</li>\n<li>Valuation Ratios</li>\n<li>Operating Ratios</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch9-image1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1095\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"171\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch9-image11.jpg\" width=\"256\"/></p>\n<p><strong>The Profitability ratios</strong> help the analyst measure the profitability of the company. The ratios convey how well the company can perform in terms of generating profits. The profitability of a company also signals the competitiveness of the management. As the profits are needed for business expansion and to pay dividends to its shareholders, a company’s profitability is an important consideration.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch9-image2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1096\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"171\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch9-image2.jpg\" width=\"256\"/></p>\n<p><strong>The Leverage ratios</strong> also referred to as solvency ratios/ gearing ratios measures the company’s ability (in the long term) to sustain its day to day operations. Leverage ratios measure the extent to which the company uses the debt to finance growth. Remember for the company to sustain its operations, it has to pay its bills and obligations. Solvency ratios help us understand the company’s long term sustainability, keeping its obligation in perspective.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch9-image3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1102\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"171\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch9-image32.jpg\" width=\"256\"/></p>\n<p><strong>The Valuation ratios</strong> compare the company’s stock price with either the profitability of the company or the company’s overall value to get a sense of how cheap, or expensive the stock is trading. Thus, this ratio helps us analyse whether the company’s current share price is perceived as high or low. In simpler words, the valuation ratio compares the cost of security with the perks of owning the stock.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch9-image4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1098\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"171\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch9-image4.jpg\" width=\"256\"/></p>\n<p><strong>The Operating Ratios</strong> also called the ‘Activity Ratios’ measures the efficiency at which a business can convert its assets (both current and noncurrent) into revenues. This ratio helps us understand how efficient the management of the company is. For this reason, Operating Ratios are sometimes called the ‘Management Ratios’.</p>\n<p>Strictly speaking, ratios (irrespective of the category it belongs to) convey a certain message, usually related to the company’s financial position. For example, ‘Profitability Ratio’ can convey the company’s efficiency, which is usually measured by computing the ‘Operating Ratio’. Because of such overlaps, it is difficult to classify these ratios. Hence the ratios are ‘somewhat loosely’ classified.</p>\n<h2>9.3 – The Profitability Ratios</h2>\n<p>We will look into the following ratios under ‘The Profitability Ratio’:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>EBITDA Margin (Operating Profit Margin)\n<ul type=\"a\">\n<li>EBITDA Growth (CAGR)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>PAT Margin\n<ul type=\"a\">\n<li>PAT Growth (CAGR)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Return on Equity (ROE)</li>\n<li>Return on Asset (ROA)</li>\n<li>Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">EBITDA Margin:</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>The Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation &amp; Amortization (EBITDA) margin</strong> indicates the efficiency of the management. It tells us how efficient the company’s operating model is. EBITDA Margin tells us how profitable (in percentage terms) the company is at an operating level. It always makes sense to compare the company’s EBITDA margin versus its competitor to get a sense of the management’s efficiency in terms of managing their expense.</p>\n<p>To calculate the EBITDA Margin, we first need to calculate the EBITDA itself.</p>\n<p><strong>EBITDA = [Operating Revenues – Operating Expense</strong>]</p>\n<p>Operating Revenues = [Total Revenue – Other Income]</p>\n<p>Operating Expense = [Total Expense – Finance Cost – Depreciation &amp; Amortization]</p>\n<p><strong>EBIDTA Margin = EBITDA / [Total Revenue – Other Income]</strong></p>\n<p>Continuing the example of Amara Raja Batteries Limited, the EBITDA Margin calculation for the FY14 is as follows:</p>\n<p>We first calculate EBITDA, which is computed as follows:</p>\n<p>[Total Revenue – Other Income] – [Total Expense – Finance Cost – Depreciation &amp; Amortization]</p>\n<p>Note: Other income is income under investments and other non-operational activity. Including other income in EBITDA calculation would clearly skew the data. For this reason, we have to exclude Other Income from Total Revenues.</p>\n<p>[3482 – 46] – [2942 – 0.7 – 65]</p>\n<p>= [3436] – [2876]</p>\n<p><strong>= 560 Crores</strong></p>\n<p>Hence the EBITDA Margin is:</p>\n<p>560 / 3436</p>\n<p><strong>= 16.3%</strong></p>\n<p>I have two questions for you at this stage:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What do an EBITDA of Rs.560 Crs and an EBITDA margin of 16.3% indicate?</li>\n<li>How good or bad an EBITDA margin of 16.3% is?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first question is fairly simple. An EBITDA of Rs.560 Crs means that the company has retained Rs.560 Crs from its operating revenue of Rs.3436 Crs. This also means out of Rs.3436 Crs the company spent Rs.2876 Crs towards its expenses. In percentage terms, the company spent 83.7% of its revenue towards its expenses and retained 16.3% of the revenue at the operating level, for its operations.</p>\n<p>Now for the 2<sup>nd</sup> question, hopefully, you should <strong>not</strong> have an answer.</p>\n<p>Remember, we did discuss this point earlier in this chapter. A financial ratio on its own conveys very little information. To make sense of it, we should either see the trend or compare it with its peers. Going with this, a 16.3% EBITDA margin conveys very little information.</p>\n<p>To makes some sense of the EBITDA margin, let us look at Amara Raja’s EBITDA margin trend for the last 4 years, (all numbers in Rs Crs, except EBITDA margin):</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th>Operating Revenues</th>\n<th>Operating Expense</th>\n<th>EBITDA</th>\n<th>EBITDA Margin</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2011</td>\n<td>1761</td>\n<td>1504</td>\n<td>257</td>\n<td>14.6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2012</td>\n<td>2364</td>\n<td>2025</td>\n<td>340</td>\n<td>14.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2013</td>\n<td>2959</td>\n<td>2508</td>\n<td>451</td>\n<td>15.2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2014</td>\n<td>3437</td>\n<td>2876</td>\n<td>560</td>\n<td>16.3%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It appears that ARBL has maintained its EBITDA at an average of 15%, and in fact, on a closer look it is clear the EBITDA margin is increasing. This is a good sign as it shows consistency and efficiency in the management’s operational capabilities.</p>\n<p>In 2011 the EBITDA was Rs.257 Crs, and in 2014 the EBITDA is Rs.560Crs. This translates to a 4 year <strong>EBITDA CAGR growth</strong> of 21%.</p>\n<p>Please note, we have discussed the formula for CAGR in <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-stock-markets/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">module 1</a>.</p>\n<p>Clearly, it appears that both the EBITDA margin and EBITDA growth are quite impressive. However, we still do not know if it is the best. To find out if it is the best one needs to compare these numbers with its competitors. In the case of ARBL, it would be Exide batteries Limited. I would encourage you to do the same for Exide and compare the results.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">PAT Margin:</span></strong></p>\n<p>While the EBITDA margin is calculated at the operating level, the Profit After Tax (PAT) margin is calculated at the final profitability level. At the operating level, we consider only the operating expenses; however, other expenses such as depreciation and finance costs are not considered. Along with these expenses, there are tax expenses as well. When we calculate the PAT margin, all expenses are deducted from the company’s Total Revenues to identify the company’s overall profitability.</p>\n<p><strong>PAT Margin = [PAT/Total Revenues]</strong></p>\n<p>PAT is explicitly stated in the Annual Report. ARBL’s PAT for the FY14 is Rs.367 Crs on the overall revenue of Rs.3482 Crs (including other income). This translates to a PAT margin of:</p>\n<p>= 367 / 3482</p>\n<p>=10.5 %</p>\n<p>Here is the PAT and PAT margin trend for ARBL:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th>PAT (in INR Crs)</th>\n<th>PAT Margin</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2011</td>\n<td>148</td>\n<td>8.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2012</td>\n<td>215</td>\n<td>8.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2013</td>\n<td>287</td>\n<td>9.6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2014</td>\n<td>367</td>\n<td>10.5%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The PAT and PAT margin trend seems impressive as we can clearly see a margin expansion. The 4-year CAGR growth stands at 25.48%, which is again good. Needless to say, it always makes sense to compare ratios with its competitors.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Return on Equity (RoE):</span></strong></p>\n<p>The Return on Equity (RoE) is a critical ratio, as it helps the investor assess the return the shareholder earns for every unit of capital invested. RoE measures the entity’s ability to generate profits from the shareholder’s investments. In other words, RoE shows the efficiency of the company in terms of generating profits to its shareholders. Obviously, the higher the RoE, the better it is for the shareholders. In fact, this is one of the key ratios that help the investor identify investable attributes of the company. The average RoE of top Indian companies varies between 14 – 16% to give you a perspective. I personally prefer to invest in companies that have an RoE of 18% upwards.</p>\n<p>This ratio is compared with the other companies in the same industry and is also observed over time.</p>\n<p>Also note, if the RoE is high, a good amount of cash is being generated by the company. Hence the need for external funds is less. Thus a higher ROE indicates a higher level of management performance.</p>\n<p><strong>RoE can be calculated as: [Net Profit / Shareholders Equity* 100]</strong></p>\n<p>There is no doubt that RoE is an important ratio to calculate, but like any other financial ratios, it also has a few drawbacks. To help you understand its drawbacks, consider this hypothetical example.</p>\n<p>Assume Vishal runs a Pizza store. To bake pizza’s Vishal needs an oven which costs him Rs.10,000/-. The oven is an asset to Vishal’s business. He procures the oven from his own funds and seeks no external debt. You would agree on his balance sheet that he has shareholder equity of Rs.10,000 and an asset equivalent to Rs.10,000.</p>\n<p>Now, assume in his first year of operation, Vishal generates a profit of Rs.2500/-. What is his RoE? This is quite simple to compute:</p>\n<p>RoE = 2500/10000*100</p>\n<p>=25.0%.</p>\n<p>Now let us twist the story a bit. Vishal has only Rs.8000/- he borrows Rs.2000 from his father to purchase an oven worth Rs.10000/-. How do you think his balance sheet would look?</p>\n<p>On the liability side, he would have:</p>\n<p>Shareholder Equity = Rs.8000</p>\n<p>Debt = Rs.2000</p>\n<p>This makes Vishal’s total liability Rs. 10,000. Balancing this on the asset side, he has an asset worth Rs.10,000. Let us see how his RoE looks now:</p>\n<p>RoE = 2500 / 8000*100</p>\n<p>= 31.25%</p>\n<p>With an additional debt, the RoE shot up quite significantly. Now, what if Vishal had only Rs.5000 and borrowed the additional Rs.5000 from his father to buy the oven. His balance sheet would look like this:</p>\n<p>On the liability side, he would have:</p>\n<p>Shareholder Equity = Rs.5000</p>\n<p>Debt = Rs.5000</p>\n<p>Vishal’s total liability is Rs. 10,000. Balancing this on the asset side, he has an asset worth Rs.10,000. Let us see how his RoE looks now:</p>\n<p>RoE = 2500 / 5000 *100</p>\n<p>=50.0%</p>\n<p>Clearly, higher the debt Vishal seeks to finance his asset, (which in turn is required to generate profits) higher is the RoE. A high RoE is great, but certainly not at the cost of high debt. The problem is with a high amount of debt, running the business gets very risky as the finance cost increases drastically. For this reason, inspecting the RoE closely becomes extremely important. One way to do this is by implementing a technique called the <strong>‘DuPont Model’ also called DuPont Identity.</strong></p>\n<p>This model was developed in the 1920s by the DuPont Corporation. DuPont Model breaks up the RoE formula into three components, representing a certain aspect of the business. The DuPont analysis uses both the P&amp;L statement and the Balance sheet for the computation.</p>\n<p>The RoE as per DuPont model can be calculated as:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch9-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1094\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"42\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch9-Chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch9-Chart1.jpg 577w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/M3-Ch9-Chart1-300x22.jpg 300w\" width=\"577\"/></p>\n<p>If you notice the above formula, the denominator and the numerator cancel out with one another eventually leaving us with the original RoE formula which is:</p>\n<p><strong>RoE = Net Profit / Shareholder Equity *100</strong></p>\n<p>However, in decomposing the RoE formula, we gained insights into three distinct aspects of the business. Let us look into the three components of the DuPont model that makes up the RoE formula :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Net Profit Margin = Net Profits/ Net Sales*100</strong><br/>\nThis is the first part of the DuPont Model, and it expresses the company’s ability to generate profits. This is nothing but the PAT margin we looked at earlier in this chapter. A low Net profit margin would indicate higher costs and increased competition.</li>\n<li><strong>Asset Turnover = Net Sales / Average Total asset.</strong><br/>\nAsset turnover ratio is an efficiency ratio that indicates how efficiently the company is using its assets to generate revenue. Higher the ratio, it means the company is using its assets more efficiently. Lower the ratio, it could indicate management or production problems. The resulting figure is expressed as several times per year.</li>\n<li><strong>Financial Leverage = Average Total Assets / Shareholders Equity</strong><br/>\nFinancial leverage helps us answer this question – ‘For every unit of shareholders equity, how many units of assets does the company have’. For example, if the financial leverage is 4, for every Rs.1 of equity, the company supports Rs.4 worth of assets. Higher the financial leverage, along with increased amounts of debt, will indicate the company is highly leveraged, and hence the investor should exercise caution. The resulting figure is expressed as several times per year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, the DuPont model breaks up the RoE formula into three distinct components, with each component giving an insight into the company’s operating and financial capabilities.</p>\n<p>Let us now proceed to implement the DuPont Model to calculate Amara Raja’s RoE for FY 14. For this, we need to calculate the values of the individual components.</p>\n<p><strong>Net Profit Margin</strong>: As I mentioned earlier, this is same as the PAT margin. From our calculation earlier, we know the Net Profit Margin for ARBL is <strong>9.2%</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Asset Turnover = Net Sales / Average Total Assets.</strong></p>\n<p>We know from the FY14 Annual Report, Net sales of ARBL stands at Rs.3437 Crs.</p>\n<p>The denominator has Average Total Assets which we know can be sourced from the Balance Sheet. But what does the word ‘Average’ indicate?</p>\n<p>From ARBL’s balance sheet, the total asset for FY14 is Rs.2139Crs. The reported number is for the Financial Year 2014, which starts from 1<sup>st</sup> of April 2013 and close on 31<sup>st</sup> March 2014. This implies that at the start of the financial year 2014 (1<sup>st</sup> April 2013), the company must have commenced its operation with assets carried forward from the previous financial year (FY 2013). During the financial year (FY 2014), the company has acquired some more assets which, when added to the previous year’s (FY2013) assets totalled to Rs.2139 Crs. Clearly, the company started the financial year with a certain rupee value of assets but closed the year with a totally different rupee value of assets.</p>\n<p>Keeping this in perspective, if I were to calculate the asset turnover ratio, which asset value should I consider for the denominator? Should I consider the asset value at the beginning of the year or the asset value at the end of the year? To avoid confusion, the practice is to take an average of the two financial years’ asset values.</p>\n<p>Do remember this technique of averaging line items, as we will be using this across other ratios.</p>\n<p>From ARBL’s annual report, we know:</p>\n<p>Net Sales in FY14 is Rs.3437Cr</p>\n<p>Total Assets in FY13 is Rs.1770 Cr</p>\n<p>Total Assets in FY14 is Rs.2139 Cr</p>\n<p>Average Assets = (1770 + 2139) / 2</p>\n<p>= 1955</p>\n<p>Asset Turnover = 3437 / 1955</p>\n<p>= <strong>1.75 times</strong></p>\n<p>This means for every Rs.1 of asset deployed; the company is generating Rs.1.75 in revenues.</p>\n<p>We will now calculate the last component, that is the Financial Leverage.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial Leverage = Average Total Assets / Average Shareholders Equity</strong></p>\n<p>We know the average total assets is Rs.1955. We just need to look into the shareholder’s equity. For reasons similar to taking the “Average Assets” instead of just the current year assets, we will consider “Average Shareholder equity” as opposed to just the current year’s shareholder equity.</p>\n<p>Shareholders Equity for FY13 = Rs.1059 Crs</p>\n<p>Shareholders Equity for FY14 = Rs.1362 Crs</p>\n<p>Average shareholder equity = Rs.1211 Crs</p>\n<p>Financial Leverage = 1955 / 1211</p>\n<p>= <strong>1.61 times</strong></p>\n<p>Considering ARBL has little debt, Financial Leverage of 1.61 is indeed an encouraging number. The number above indicates that for every Rs.1 of Equity, ARBL supports Rs.1.61 of assets.</p>\n<p>We now have all the inputs to calculate RoE for ARBL; we will now proceed to do the same:</p>\n<p><strong>RoE = Net Profit Margin X Asset Turnover X Financial Leverage</strong></p>\n<p>= 9.2% * 1.75 * 1.61</p>\n<p><strong>~ 25.9%. </strong>Quite impressive, I must say!</p>\n<p>I understand this is a lengthy way to calculate RoE, but this is perhaps the best way to calculate RoE, we can develop valuable insights into the business. DuPont model not only answers what the return is but also the quality of the return.</p>\n<p>However, if you wish to do a quick RoE calculation, you can do so the following way:</p>\n<p><strong>RoE = Net Profits / Avg shareholders Equity</strong></p>\n<p>From the annual report we know for the FY14 the PAT is Rs.367 Cr.</p>\n<p>RoE = 367 / 1211</p>\n<p><strong>= 30.31%</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Return on Asset (RoA):</span></strong></p>\n<p>Having understood the DuPont Model, understanding the next two ratios should be simple. Return on Assets (RoA) evaluates the effectiveness of the entity’s ability to use the assets to create profits. A well-managed entity limits investments in non-productive assets. Hence RoA indicates the management’s efficiency at deploying its assets. Needless to say, the higher the ROA, the better it is.</p>\n<p><strong>RoA = [Net income + interest*(1-tax rate)] / Total Average Assets</strong></p>\n<p>From the Annual Report, we know:</p>\n<p>Net income for FY 14 = Rs.367.4 Crs</p>\n<p>And we know from the Dupont Model the Total average assets (FY13 and FY14) = Rs.1955 Cr.</p>\n<p>So what does <strong>interest *(1- tax rate)</strong> mean? Well, think about it, the loan taken by the company is also used to finance the assets, which in turn is used to generate profits. So in a sense, the debtholders (entities who have given a loan to the company) are also a part of the company. From this perspective, the interest paid out also belongs to a stakeholder of the company. The company also benefits in terms of paying lesser taxes when interest is paid out; this is called a ‘tax shield’. For these reasons, we need to add interest (by accounting for the tax shield) while calculating the ROA.</p>\n<p>The Interest amount (finance cost) is Rs.7 Crs, accounting for the tax shield it would be</p>\n<p>= 7* (1 – 32%)</p>\n<p>= 4.76 Cr. Please note, 32% is the average tax rate.</p>\n<p>Hence ROA would be –</p>\n<p>RoA = [367.4 + 4.76] / 1955</p>\n<p>~ 372.16 / 1955</p>\n<p><strong>~19.03% </strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):</span></strong></p>\n<p>The Return on Capital employed indicates the company’s profitability, taking into consideration the overall capital it employs.</p>\n<p>Overall capital includes both equity and debt (both long term and short term).</p>\n<p><strong>ROCE = [Profit before Interest &amp; Taxes / Overall Capital Employed]</strong></p>\n<p>Overall Capital Employed = Short term Debt + Long term Debt + Equity.</p>\n<p>From ARBL’s Annual Report, we know:</p>\n<p>Profit before Interest &amp; Taxes = Rs.537.7 Crs</p>\n<p>Overall Capital Employed:</p>\n<p>Short term debt: Rs.8.3 Cr</p>\n<p>Long term borrowing: Rs.75.9 Cr</p>\n<p>Shareholders equity = Rs.1362 Cr</p>\n<p>Overall capital employed: 8.3 + 75.9 + 1362 = 1446.2 Crs</p>\n<p>ROCE = 537.7 / 1446.2</p>\n<p><strong>= 37.18%</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A Financial ratio is a useful financial metric of a company.

The use of leverage (debt) is like a double edged sword.</p>\n<p>Well managed companies seek debt if they foresee a situation where, they can deploy the debt funds in an environment which generates a higher return in contrast to the interest payments the company has to makes to service its debt. Do recollect a judicious use of debt to finance assets also increases the return on equity.</p>\n<p>However if a company takes on too much debt, then the interest paid to service the debt eats into the profit share of the shareholders. Hence there is a very thin line that separates the good and the bad debt. Leverage ratios mainly deal with the overall extent of the company’s debt, and help us understand the company’s financial leverage better.</p>\n<p>We will be looking into the following leverage ratios:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Interest Coverage Ratio</li>\n<li>Debt to Equity Ratio</li>\n<li>Debt to Asset Ratio</li>\n<li>Financial Leverage Ratio</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So far we have been using Amara Raja Batteries Limited (ARBL) as an example, however to understand leverage ratios, we will look into a company that has a sizable debt on its balance sheet. I have chosen Jain Irrigation Systems Limited (JISL), I would encourage you calculate the ratios for a company of your choice.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Interest Coverage Ratio:</span></strong><br/>\nThe interest coverage ratio is also referred to as debt service ratio or the debt service coverage ratio. The interest coverage ratio helps us understand how much the company is earning relative to the interest burden of the company. This ratio helps us interpret how easily a company can pay its interest payments. For example, if the company has an interest burden of Rs.100 versus an income of Rs.400, then we clearly know that the company has sufficient funds to service its debt. However a low interest coverage ratio could mean a higher debt burden and a greater possibility of bankruptcy or default.</p>\n<p>The formula to calculate the interest coverage ratio:<br/>\n<strong>[Earnings before Interest and Tax / Interest Payment</strong>]</p>\n<p>The ‘Earnings before Interest and Tax’ (EBIT) is:<br/>\nEBITDA – Depreciation &amp; Amortization</p>\n<p>Let us apply this ratio on Jain Irrigation Limited. Here is the snapshot of Jain Irrigation’s P&amp;L statement for the FY 14, I have highlighted the Finance costs in red:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch10-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1151\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"449\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-chart1.jpg\" width=\"495\"/></p>\n<p>We know EBITDA = [Revenue –  Expenses]</p>\n<p>To calculate the expenses, we exclude the Finance cost (Rs.467.64Crs) and Depreciation &amp; Amortization cost (Rs.204.54) from the total expenses of Rs.5730.34 Crs.</p>\n<p>Therefore EBITDA = Rs.5828.13 – 5058.15 Crs<br/>\nEBITDA = Rs. 769.98 Crs</p>\n<p>We know EBIT = EBITDA – [Depreciation &amp; Amortization]</p>\n<p>= Rs.769.98 – 204.54</p>\n<p>= Rs. 565.44</p>\n<p>We know Finance Cost = Rs.467.64,</p>\n<p>Hence Interest coverage is:</p>\n<p>= 565.44/ 467.64<br/>\n<strong>= 1.209x</strong></p>\n<p>The ‘x’ in the above number represents a multiple. Hence 1.209x should be read as 1.209 ‘times’.</p>\n<p>Interest coverage ratio of 1.209x suggests that for every Rupee of interest payment due, Jain Irrigation Limited is generating an EBIT of 1.209 times.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Debt to Equity Ratio:</span></strong><br/>\nThis is a fairly straightforward ratio. Both the variables required for this computation can be found in the Balance Sheet. It measures the amount of the total debt capital with respect to the total equity capital. A value of 1 on this ratio indicates an equal amount of debt and equity capital. Higher debt to equity (more than 1) indicates higher leverage and hence one needs to be careful. Lower than 1 indicates a relatively bigger equity base with respect to the debt.</p>\n<p>The formula to calculate Debt to Equity ratio is:<br/>\n<strong>[Total Debt/Total Equity]</strong></p>\n<p>Please note, the total debt here includes both the short term debt and the long term debt.</p>\n<p>Here is JSIL’s Balance Sheet, I have highlighted total equity, long term, and short term debt:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch10-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1152\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"340\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-chart2.jpg\" width=\"503\"/></p>\n<p>Total debt = Long term borrowings + Short term borrowings<br/>\n= 1497.663 + 2188.915<br/>\n= Rs.3686.578Crs<br/>\nTotal Equity is Rs.2175.549 Crs</p>\n<p>Thus, Debt to Equity ratio will be computed as follows:<br/>\n= 3686.578 / 2175.549<br/>\n<strong>= 1.69</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Debt to Asset Ratio:</span></strong><br/>\nThis ratio helps us understand the asset financing pattern of the company. It conveys to us how much of the total assets are financed through debt capital.</p>\n<p>The formula to calculate the same is:<br/>\n<strong>Total Debt / Total Assets</strong></p>\n<p>For JSIL, we know the total debt is Rs.3686.578Crs.<br/>\nFrom the Balance Sheet, we know the total assets as Rs.8204.447 Crs:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch10-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1153\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"232\" sizes=\"(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-chart3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-chart3.jpg 626w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-chart3-300x140.jpg 300w\" width=\"497\"/></p>\n<p>Hence the Debt to Asset ratio is:<br/>\n=3686.578 / 8204.44<br/>\n<strong>= 0.449 or ~45%.</strong></p>\n<p>This means roughly about 45% of the assets held by JSIL is financed through debt capital or creditors (and therefore 55% is financed by the owners). Needless to say, higher the percentage the more concerned the investor would be as it indicates higher leverage and risk.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Financial Leverage Ratio</span></strong><br/>\nWe briefly looked at the financial leverage ratio in the previous chapter, when we discussed about Return on Equity. The financial leverage ratio gives us an indication, to what extent the assets are supported by equity.</p>\n<p>The formula to calculate the Financial Leverage Ratio is:<br/>\n<strong>Average Total Asset / Average Total Equity</strong></p>\n<p>From JSIL’s FY14 balance sheet, I know the average total assets is Rs.8012.615.The average total equity is Rs.2171.755. Hence the financial leverage ratio or simply the leverage ratio is:<br/>\n8012.615 / 2171.755<br/>\n<strong>= 3.68</strong></p>\n<p>This means JSIL supports Rs.3.68 units of assets for every unit of equity. Do remember higher the number, higher is the company’s leverage.</p>\n<h2>10.2 – Operating Ratios</h2>\n<p>Operating Ratios also called ‘Activity ratios’ or the ‘Management ratios’ indicate the efficiency of the company’s operational activity. To some degree, the operating ratios reveal the management’s efficiency as well. These ratios are called the Asset Management Ratios, as these ratios indicate the efficiency with which the assets of the company are utilized.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch10-title2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1165\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-title21.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-title21.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-title21-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>Some of the popular Operating Ratios are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fixed Assets Turnover Ratio</li>\n<li>Working Capital Turnover Ratio</li>\n<li>Total Assets Turnover Ratio</li>\n<li>Inventory Turnover Ratio</li>\n<li>Inventory Number of Days</li>\n<li>Receivable Turnover Ratio</li>\n<li>Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The above ratios combine data from both the P&amp;L statement and Balance sheet. We will understand these ratios by calculating them for Amara Raja Batteries Limited.</p>\n<p>To get a true sense of how good or bad the operating ratios of a company are, one must compare the ratios with the company’s peers /competitors or these ratios should be compared over the years for the same company.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Fixed Assets Turnover</span></strong><br/>\nThe ratio measures the extent of the revenue generated in comparison to its investment in fixed assets. It tells us how effectively the company uses its plant and equipment. Fixed assets include the property, plant and equipment. Higher the ratio, it means the company is effectively and efficiently managing its fixed assets.</p>\n<p><strong>Fixed Assets Turnover = Operating Revenues / Total Average Asset</strong></p>\n<p>The assets considered while calculating the fixed assets turnover should be net of accumulated depreciation, which is nothing but the net block of the company. It should also include the capital work in progress. Also, we take the average assets for reasons discussed in the previous chapter.</p>\n<p>From ARBL’s FY14 Balance Sheet:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch10-chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1154\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"118\" sizes=\"(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-chart4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-chart4.jpg 582w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-chart4-300x61.jpg 300w\" width=\"582\"/></p>\n<p>= (767.864 + 461.847)/2<br/>\n= Rs.614.855 Crs<br/>\nWe know the operating revenue for FY14 is Rs.3436.7 Crs, hence the Fixed Asset Turnover ratio is:<br/>\n= 3436.7 / 614.85<br/>\n=5.59</p>\n<p>While evaluating this ratio, do keep in mind the stage the company is in. For a very well established company, the company may not be utilizing its cash to invest in fixed assets. However for a growing company, the company may invest in fixed assets and hence the fixed assets value may increase year on year. You can notice this in case of ARBL as well, for the FY13 the Fixed assets value is at Rs.461.8 Crs and for the FY14 the fixed asset value is at Rs.767.8 Crs.</p>\n<p>This ratio is mostly used by capital intensive industries to analyze how effectively the fixed assets of the company are used.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Working Capital Turnover</span></strong><br/>\nWorking capital refers to the capital required by the firm to run its day to day operations. To run the day to day operations, the company needs certain type of assets. Typically such assets are – inventories, receivables, cash etc. If you realize these are current assets. A well managed company finances the current assets by current liabilities. The difference between the current assets and current liabilities gives us the working capital of the company.</p>\n<p><strong>Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities</strong></p>\n<p>If the working capital is a positive number, it implies that the company has <strong>working capital surplus</strong> and can easily manage its day to day operations. However if the working capital is negative, it means the company has a <strong>working capital deficit</strong>. Usually if the company has a working capital deficit, they seek a working capital loan from their bankers.</p>\n<p>The concept of ‘Working Capital Management’ in itself is a huge topic in Corporate Finance. It includes inventory management, cash management, debtor’s management etc. The company’s CFO (Chief Financial Officer) strives to manage the company’s working capital efficiently. Of course, we will not get into this topic as we will digress from our main topic.</p>\n<p>The working capital turnover ratio is also referred to as Net sales to working capital. The working capital turnover indicates how much revenue the company generates for every unit of working capital. Suppose the ratio is 4, then it indicates that the company generates Rs.4 in revenue for every Rs.1 of working capital. Needless to say, higher the number, better it is. Also, do remember all ratios should be compared with its peers/competitors in the same industry and with the company’s past and planned ratio to get a deeper insight of its performance.</p>\n<p>The formula to calculate the Working Capital Turnover:<br/>\n<strong>Working Capital Turnover =</strong> <strong>[Revenue / Average Working Capital]</strong></p>\n<p>Let us implement the same for Amara Raja Batteries Limited. To begin with, we need to calculate the working capital for the FY13 and the FY14 and then find out the average. Here is the snapshot of ARBL’s Balance sheet, I have highlighted the current assets (red) and current liabilities (green) for both the years:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch10-chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1155\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"307\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-chart5.jpg\" width=\"493\"/></p>\n<p>The average working capital for the two financial years can be calculated as follows:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Current Assets for the FY13</td>\n<td>Rs.1256.85</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Current Liabilities for the FY13</td>\n<td>Rs.576.19</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"background-color: #69c969;\">Working Capital for the FY13</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"background-color: #69c969;\">Rs.680.66</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Current Asset for the FY14</td>\n<td>Rs.1298.61</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Current Liability for the FY14</td>\n<td>Rs.633.70</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"background-color: #69c969;\">Working Capital for the FY14</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"background-color: #69c969;\">Rs.664.91</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Average Working Capital</span></td>\n<td><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Rs.672.78</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>We know the revenue from operations for ARBL is Rs.3437 Crs. Hence the working capital turnover ratio is:<br/>\n= 3437 / 672.78<br/>\n= <strong>5.11 times</strong></p>\n<p>The number indicates that for every Rs.1 of working capital, the company is generating Rs.5.11 in terms of revenue. Higher the working capital turnover ratio the better it is, as it indicates the company is generating better sales in comparison with the money it uses to fund the sales.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Total Assets Turnover</span></strong><br/>\nThis is a very straight forward ratio. It indicates the company’s capability to generate revenues with the given amount of assets. Here the assets include both the fixed assets as well as current assets. A higher total asset turnover ratio compared to its historical data and competitor data means the company is using its assets well to generate more sales.</p>\n<p><strong>Total Asset Turnover = Operating Revenue / Average Total Assets</strong></p>\n<p>The average total assets for ARBL is as follws –</p>\n<p>Total Assets for FY 13 –  Rs.1770.5 Crs and Total Assets for FY 14 – 2139.4 Crs. Hence the average assets would be Rs. 1954.95 Crs.</p>\n<p>Operating revenue (FY 14) is Rs. 3437 Crs. Hence Total Asset Turnover is:<br/>\n= 3437 / 1954.95<br/>\n<strong>= 1.75 times</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Inventory Turnover Ratio</span></strong><br/>\nInventory refers to the finished goods that a company maintains in its store or showroom with an expectation of selling the finished goods to prospective clients. Typically, the company besides keeping the goods in the store would also keep some additional units of finished goods in its warehouse.</p>\n<p>If a company is selling popular products, then the goods in the inventory gets cleared rapidly, and the company has to replenish the inventory time and again. This is called the ‘Inventory turnover’.</p>\n<p>For example think about a bakery selling hot bread. If the bakery is popular, the baker probably knows how many pounds of bread he is likely to sell on any given day. For example, he could sell 200 pounds of bread daily. This means he has to maintain an inventory of 200 pounds of bread every day. So, in this case the rate of replenishing the inventory and the inventory turnover is quite high.</p>\n<p>This may not be true for every business. For instance, think of a car manufacturer. Obviously selling cars is not as easy as selling bread. If the manufacturer produces 50 cars, he may have to wait for sometime before he sells these cars. Assume, to sell 50 cars (his inventory capacity) he will need 3 months. This means, every 3 months he turns over his inventory. Hence in a year he turns over his inventory 4 times.</p>\n<p>Finally, if the product is really popular the inventory turnover would be high. This is exactly what the ‘Inventory Turnover Ratio’ indicates.</p>\n<p>The formula to calculate the ratio is:<br/>\n<strong>Inventory Turnover = [Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory]</strong></p>\n<p>Cost of goods sold is the cost involved in making the finished good. We can find this in the P&amp;L Statement of the company. Let us implement this for ARBL.</p>\n<p>To evaluate the cost of goods sold, I need to look into the expense of the company, here is the extract of the same:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch10-chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1156\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"197\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-chart6.jpg\" width=\"599\"/></p>\n<p>Cost of materials consumed is Rs.2101.19 Crs and purchases of stock-in-trade is Rs.211.36 Crs. These line items are directly related to the cost of goods sold. Along with this I would also like to inspect ‘Other Expenses’ to identify any costs that are related to the cost of goods sold. Here is the extract of Note 24, which details ‘Other Expenses’.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch10-chart7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1157\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"237\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch10-chart7.jpg\" width=\"432\"/></p>\n<p>There are two expenses that are directly related to manufacturing i.e. Stores &amp; spares consumed which is at  Rs.44.94 Crs and the Power &amp; Fuel cost which is at Rs.92.25Crs.</p>\n<p>Hence the Cost of Goods Sold = Cost of materials consumed + Purchase of stock in trade + Stores &amp; spares consumed + Power &amp; Fuel<br/>\n= 2101.19 + 211.36 + 44.94 + 92.25<br/>\nCOGS= Rs.2449.74 Crs</p>\n<p>This takes care of the numerator. For the denominator, we just take the average inventory for the FY13 and FY14. From the balance sheet – Inventory for the FY13 is Rs.292.85 Crs and for the FY14 is Rs.335.00 Crs. The average works out to Rs.313.92 Crs</p>\n<p>The Inventory turnover ratio is:<br/>\n= 2449.74 / 313.92<br/>\n<strong>= 7.8 times</strong><br/>\n<strong>~ 8.0 times a year</strong></p>\n<p>This means Amara Raja Batteries Limited turns over its inventory 8 times in a year or once in every 1.5 months. Needless to say, to get a true sense of how good or bad this number is, one should compare it with its competitor’s numbers.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Inventory Number of days</span></strong><br/>\nWhile the Inventory turnover ratio gives a sense of how many times the company  ‘replenishes’ their inventory, the ‘Inventory number of Days’ gives a sense of how much time the company takes to convert its inventory into cash. Lesser the number of days, the better it is. A short inventory number of day’s number implies, the company’s products are fast moving.  The formula to calculate the inventory number of days is:</p>\n<p><strong>Inventory Number of Days = 365 / Inventory Turnover</strong></p>\n<p>The inventory number of days is usually calculated on a yearly basis. Hence in the formula above, 365 indicates the number of days in a year.</p>\n<p>Calculating this for ARBL:<br/>\n= 365 / 7.8<br/>\n= 46.79 days<br/>\n<strong>~ 47.0 days</strong></p>\n<p>This means ARBL roughly takes about 47 days to convert its inventory into cash. Needless to say, the inventory number of days of a company should be compared with its competitors, to get a sense of how the company’s products are moving.</p>\n<p>Now here is something for you to think about – What would you think about the following situation?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A certain company under consideration has a high inventory turnover ratio</li>\n<li>Because of a high inventory turnover ratio, the inventory number of days is very low</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On the face of it, the inventory management of this company looks good. A high inventory turnover ratio signifies that the company is replenishing its inventory quickly, which is excellent. Along with the high inventory turnover, a low inventory number of days indicate that the company is quickly able to convert its goods into cash. Again, this is a sign of great inventory management.</p>\n<p>However, what if the company has a great product (hence they are able to sell quickly) but a low production capacity? Even in this case the inventory turnover will be high and inventory days will be low.  But a low production capacity can be a bit worrisome as it raises many questions about the company’s production:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why is the company not able to increase their production?</li>\n<li>Are they not able to increase production because they are short of funds?</li>\n<li>If they are short of funds, why can’t they seek a bank loan?</li>\n<li>Have they approached a bank and are not been able to raise a loan successfully?</li>\n<li>If they are not able to raise a loan, why?</li>\n<li>What if the management does not have a great track record, hence the banks hesitation to give a loan?</li>\n<li>If funds are not a problem, why can’t the company increase production?</li>\n<li>Is sourcing raw materials difficult? Is the raw material required regulated by government (like Coal, power, Oil etc).</li>\n<li>Difficult access to raw material – does that mean the business is not scalable?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As you can see, if any of the points above is true, then a red flag is raised, hence investing in the company may not be advisable. To fully understand the production issues (if any), the fundamental analyst should read through the annual report (especially the management discussion &amp; analysis report) from the beginning to the end.</p>\n<p>This means whenever you see impressive inventory numbers, always ensure to double check the production details as well.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio</span></strong><br/>\nHaving understood the inventory turnover ratio, understanding the receivable turnover ratio should be quite easy. The receivable turnover ratio indicates how many times in a given period the company receives money/cash from its debtors and customers. Naturally a high number indicates that the company collects cash more frequently.</p>\n<p>The formula to calculate the same is:<br/>\n<strong>Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio = Revenue / Average Receivables</strong></p>\n<p>From the balance sheet we know,<br/>\nTrade Receivable for the FY13 : Rs.380.67 Crs<br/>\nTrade Receivable for the FY14 : Rs. 452.78 Crs<br/>\nAverage Receivable for the FY13 : Rs.416.72<br/>\nOperating Revenue for the FY14 : Rs.3437 Crs</p>\n<p>Hence the Receivable Turnover Ratio is:<br/>\n= 3437 / 416.72<br/>\n= 8.24 times a year<br/>\n~ 8.0 times</p>\n<p>This means ARBL receives cash from its customers roughly about 8.24 times a year or once every month and a half.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) )/ Average Collection Period/ Day Sales in Receivables</span></strong><br/>\nThe days sales outstanding ratio illustrates the average cash collection period i.e the time lag between billing and collection. This calculation shows the efficiency of the company’s collection department. Quicker/faster the cash is collected from the creditors, faster the cash can be used for other activities. The formula to calculate the same is:</p>\n<p><strong>Days Sales outstanding = 365 /</strong> <strong>Receivable Turnover Ratio </strong></p>\n<p>Solving this for ARBL,<br/>\n= 365 / 8.24<br/>\n= 44.29 days</p>\n<p>This means ARBL takes about 45 days from the time it raises an invoice to the time it can collect its money against the invoice.</p>\n<p>Both Receivables Turnover and the DSO indicate the credit policy of the firm. A efficiently run company, should strike the right balance between the credit policy and the credit it extends to its customers.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Leverage ratios include Interest Coverage, Debt to Equity, Debt to Assets and the Financial Leverage ratios</li>\n<li>The Leverage ratios mainly study the company’s debt with respect to the company’s ability to service the long term debt</li>\n<li>Interest coverage ratio inspects the company’s earnings ability (at the EBIT level) as a multiple of its finance costs</li>\n<li>Debt to equity ratio measures the amount of equity capital with respect to the debt capital.

In the context of investments, ‘something’ refers to the price of a stock. When making an investment decision, irrespective of how attractive the business appears, what matters finally is the business’s valuation. Valuations dictate the price you pay to acquire a business. Sometimes, a mediocre business at a ridiculously cheap valuation may be a great investment option instead of an exciting business with an extremely high valuation.</p>\n<p>The valuation ratios help us develop a sense of how the market participants value the stock price. These ratios help us understand the attractiveness of the stock price from an investment perspective. The point of valuation ratios is to compare the price of a stock viz a viz the benefits of owning it. Like all the other ratios we had looked at, a company’s valuation ratios should be evaluated alongside the company’s competitors.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch11-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1236\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch11-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch11-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch11-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>Valuation ratios are usually computed as a ratio of the company’s share price to an aspect of its financial performance. We will be looking at the following three important valuation ratios:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Price to Sales (P/S) Ratio</li>\n<li>Price to Book Value (P/BV) Ratio and</li>\n<li>Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Continuing with the Amara Raja Batteries Limited (ARBL) example, let us implement these ratios to see how ARBL fares. The stock price of ARBL is a vital input used to calculate the valuation ratios. As I write this chapter on 28<sup>th</sup> of Oct 2014, ARBL trades at Rs.661 per share.</p>\n<p>We also need the total number of shares outstanding in ARBL to calculate the above ratios. If you recollect, we have calculated the same in chapter 6. The total number of shares outstanding is 17,08,12,500 or 17.081Crs</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Price to Sales (P/S) Ratio</strong></p>\n<p>In many cases, investors may use sales instead of earnings to value their investments. The earnings figure may not be true as some companies might be experiencing a cyclical low in their earning cycle. Additionally, due to some accounting rules, a profitable company may seem to have no earnings at all, due to the huge write-offs applicable to that industry. So, investors would prefer to use this ratio. This ratio compares the stock price of the company with the company’s sales per share. The formula to calculate the P/S ratio is:</p>\n<p><strong>Price to sales ratio = Current Share Price / Sales per Share</strong></p>\n<p>Let us calculate the same for ARBL. We will take up the denominator first:</p>\n<p>Sales per share = Total Revenues / Total number of shares</p>\n<p>We know from ARBL’s P&amp;L statement:</p>\n<p>Total Revenue = Rs.3482 Cr</p>\n<p>Number of Shares = 17.081 Cr</p>\n<p>Sales per share = 3482 / 17.081</p>\n<p>Therefore the Sales per share = Rs. 203.86</p>\n<p>This means for every share outstanding, ARBL does Rs.203.86 worth of sales.</p>\n<p>Price to Sales Ratio = 661 / 203.86</p>\n<p><strong>= 3.24x or 3.24 times</strong></p>\n<p>A P/S ratio of 3.24 times indicates that, for every Rs.1 of sales, the stock is valued Rs.3.24 times higher. Obviously, the higher the P/S ratio, the higher is the valuation of the firm. One has to compare the P/S ratio with its competitors to get a fair sense of how expensive or cheap the stock is.</p>\n<p>Here is something that you need to remember while calculating the P/S ratio. Assume there are two companies (Company A and Company B) selling the same product. Both companies generate a revenue of Rs.1000/-each. However, Company A retains Rs.250 as PAT and Company B retains Rs.150 as PAT. In this case, Company A has a profit margin of 25% versus Company B’s, which has a 15% profit margin. Hence, Company A’s sales are more valuable than Company B. Hence, if Company A is trading at a higher P/S. The valuation may be justified because every rupee of sales Company A generates, a higher profit is retained.</p>\n<p>Whenever you feel a particular company is trading at a higher valuation from the P/S ratio perspective, do remember to check the profit margin for cues.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Price to Book Value (P/BV) Ratio</strong></p>\n<p>Before we understand the Price to Book Value ratio, we need to understand the term ‘Book Value’ means.</p>\n<p>Consider a situation where the company has to close down its business and liquidate all its assets. What is the minimum value the company receives upon liquidation? The answer to this lies in the “Book Value” of the firm.</p>\n<p>The “Book Value” of a firm is simply the amount of money left on the table after the company pays off its obligations. Consider the book value as the salvage value of the company. Suppose the book value of a company is Rs.200Crs, then this is the amount of money the company can expect to receive after it sells everything and settles its debts. Usually, the book value is expressed on a per-share basis. For example, if the book value per share is Rs.60, then Rs.60 per share is what the shareholder can expect if the company decides to liquidate. The ‘Book Value’ (BV) can be calculated as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>BV = [Share Capital + Reserves (excluding revaluation reserves) / Total Number of shares]</strong></p>\n<p>Let us calculate the same for ARBL:</p>\n<p>From ARBL’s balance sheet, we know:</p>\n<p>Share Capital = Rs.17.1 Crs</p>\n<p>Reserves = Rs.1345.6 Crs</p>\n<p>Revaluation Reserves = 0</p>\n<p>Number of shares: 17.081</p>\n<p>Hence the Book Value per share = [17.1+1345.6 – 0] / 17.081</p>\n<p>= Rs.79.8 per share</p>\n<p>This means if ARBL were to liquidate all its assets and pay off its debt, Rs.79.8 per shares is what the shareholders can expect.</p>\n<p>Moving ahead, if we divide the stock’s current market price by the book value per share, we will get the price to the firm’s book value. The P/BV indicates how many times the stock is trading over and above the firm’s book value. Clearly, the higher the ratio, the more expensive the stock is.</p>\n<p>Let us calculate this for ARBL. We know:</p>\n<p>The stock price of ARBL = Rs.661 per share</p>\n<p>BV of ARBL = 79.8 per share</p>\n<p>P/BV = 661/79.8</p>\n<p><strong>= 8.3x or 8.3 times</strong></p>\n<p>This means ARBL is trading over 8.3 times its book value.</p>\n<p>A high ratio could indicate that the firm is overvalued relative to the company’s equity/ book value. A low ratio could indicate the company is undervalued relative to the equity/ book value.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Price to Earning (P/E) Ratio</strong></p>\n<p>The Price to Earnings ratio is perhaps the most popular financial ratio. Everybody likes to check the P/E of a stock. Because of the popularity, the P/E ratio enjoys, it is often considered the ‘financial ratio superstar’.</p>\n<p>The P/E of a stock is calculated by dividing the <strong>current stock price</strong> by the <strong>Earning Per Share</strong> (EPS). Before we proceed to understand the PE ratio, let us understand what “Earnings per Share” (EPS) stands for.</p>\n<p>EPS measures the profitability of a company on a per-share basis. For example, assume a certain company with 1000 shares outstanding generates a profit of Rs.200000/-.  Then the earnings on a per-share basis would be:</p>\n<p>=200000 / 1000</p>\n<p>= Rs.200 per share.</p>\n<p>Hence the EPS gives us a sense of the profits generated on a per-share basis. Clearly, higher the EPS, better it is for its shareholders.</p>\n<p>If you divide the current market price with EPS, we get the Price to Earnings ratio. The P/E ratio measures the market participants’ willingness to pay for the stock, for every rupee of profit that the company generates. For example, if the P/E of a certain firm is 15, it simply means that the company earns the market participants for every unit of profit the company earns, the market participants are willing to pay 15 times. Higher the P/E, more expensive is the stock.</p>\n<p>Let us calculate the P/E for ARBL. We know from its annual report –</p>\n<p>PAT = Rs.367Crs</p>\n<p>Total Number of Shares = 17.081 Cr</p>\n<p>EPS = PAT / Total Number of shares</p>\n<p>= 367 / 17.081</p>\n<p>= Rs.21.49</p>\n<p>Current Market Price of ARBL = 661</p>\n<p>Hence P/E = 661 / 21.49</p>\n<p><strong>= 30.76 times</strong></p>\n<p>This means for every unit of profit generated by ARBL; the market participants are willing to pay Rs.30.76 to acquire the share.</p>\n<p>Now assume, ARBL’s price jumps to Rs.750 while the EPS remains at Rs.21.49, the new P/E would be:</p>\n<p>= 750/21.49</p>\n<p>= 34.9 times</p>\n<p>While the EPS stayed flat at Rs.21.49 per share, the stock’s P/E jumped. Why do you think this happened?</p>\n<p>Clearly, the P/E Ratio jumped because of the increase in the stock price as we know the company’s stock price increases when the expectations from the company increase.</p>\n<p>Remember, P/E Ratio is calculated with ‘earnings’ in its denominator. While looking at the P/E ratio, do remember the following key points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>P/E indicates how expensive or cheap the stock is trading at. Never buy stocks that are trading at high valuations. Personally, I wouldn’t say I like to buy stocks that are trading beyond 25 or at the most 30 times its earnings, irrespective of the company and the sector it belongs to</li>\n<li>The denominator in P/E ratio is the ‘Earnings’, and the earnings can be manipulated.</li>\n<li>Make sure the company is not changing its accounting policy too often – this is one way the company tries to manipulate its earnings.</li>\n<li>Pay attention to the way depreciation is treated. Provision for lesser depreciation can boost earnings.</li>\n<li>If the company’s earnings are increasing but not its cash flows and sales, something is clearly not right.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>11.2 – The Index Valuation</h2>\n<p>Like a stock, the stock market indices such as the BSE Sensex and the CNX Nifty 50 have their valuations measured by the P/E, P/B and Dividend Yield ratios. The stock exchanges usually publish the Index valuation daily. The index valuations give us a sense of how cheap or expensive the market is trading at. To calculate the CNX Nifty 50 P/E ratio, the National Stock Exchange combines the market capitalization for all the 50 stocks and divides that amount by the combined earnings for all the 50 stocks.

These chapters have laid the foundation for this module’s final objective: – To use fundamental analysis to identify the stocks to invest. If you recollect in the earlier chapters, we had discussed investable grade attributes. Investable grade attributes define a company’s prerequisites that need to be validated before making an investment decision.  Think of the investable grade attributes as a checklist based on the fundamentals of the company. A company that satisfies most of the items in the checklist is considered investment-worthy.</p>\n<p>Now, this is where few differences come up. For instance, what I consider as an investable grade attribute may not be so important to you. For example, – I may pay a lot of attention to corporate governance, but another investor may choose not to pay so much attention to corporate governance. He could brush it off saying “all companies have shades of grey, as long as the numbers add up I am fine investing in the company”.</p>\n<p>So the point is, there is no prescribed checklist. Each investor has to build his own checklist based on his investment experience. However, one has to ensure that each item on the checklist is qualified based on sound logic. Later in this chapter, I will share a checklist that I think is reasonably well-curated. You could take pointers from this checklist if you are starting fresh. We will keep this checklist as a guideline and proceed further in this module.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch12-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1243\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch12-title1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch12-title1.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch12-title1-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>12.2 – Generating a stock idea</h2>\n<p>Now before we proceed further and generate a checklist, we must address a more basic issue. The process of investing requires us first to select a stock that looks interesting. After selecting the stock, we must subject it to the checklist to figure out if the stock matches all the checklist criteria, if it does we invest, we look for other opportunities.</p>\n<p>So in the first place, how do we even select a stock that looks interesting? In other words, how do we generate a list of stocks that seems interesting enough to investigate further? Well, there are a few methods to do this –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>General Observation</strong> – This may sound rudimentary, but believe me, this is one of the best ways to develop a stock idea. All you need to do is keep your eyes and ears open and observe the economic activity around you. Observe what people are buying and selling, see what products are being consumed, keep an eye on the neighbourhood to see what people are talking about. In fact, Peter Lynch, one of the most illustrious Wall Street investor, advocates this method in his book “One up on Wall Street”. Personally, I have used this method to pick some of my investments – PVR Cinemas Ltd (because I noticed PVR multiplexes mushrooming in the City), Cummins India Limited (because I noticed most of the buildings had a Cummins diesel generator in their premises), and Info Edge Limited (Info Edge owns naukri.com, which is probably the most preferred job portal).</li>\n<li><strong>Stock screener</strong> – A stock screener helps to screen for stocks based on the parameters you define and, therefore, help investors perform quality stock analysis. For example, you can use a stock screener to identify stocks with an ROE of 25% and PAT margins of 20%. A stock screener is a beneficial tool when you want to shortlist a handful of investment ideas from a big basket of stocks. There are many stock screeners available; I personally like the Google finance’s stock screener and screener. In.</li>\n<li><strong>Macro Trends</strong> – Keeping a general tab on the macroeconomic trend is a great way of identifying good stocks. Here is an illustration of the same – As of today, there is a great push for infrastructure projects in India. An obvious beneficiary of this push would be the cement companies operating in India. Hence, I would look through all the cement companies and apply the checklist to identify which cement companies are well-positioned to leverage this macro trend.</li>\n<li><strong>Sectoral Trends </strong>– This is sector-specific. One needs to track sectors to identify emerging trends and companies within the sector that can benefit from it. For example, the non-alcoholic beverages market is a very traditional sector. Mainly, three kinds of products are sold: coffee, tea, and packaged water. Hence, most of the companies manufacture and sell just these three products. However, there is a slight shift in the consumer taste these days – the market for energy drink is opening up, and it seems promising. Hence the investor may want to check for companies within the best-positioned sector to leverage this change and adapt to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Special Situation – </strong>This is a slightly complicated way of generating a stock idea. One has to follow companies, company-related news, company events etc., to generate an idea based on a special situation. One example that I distinctly remember was that of Cox &amp; Kings. You may know that Cox &amp; Kings is one of India’s largest and the oldest tour operator. In late 2013, the company announced Mr Keki Mistry (from HDFC Bank) to its advisory board. Corporate India has immense respect for him as he is known to be a very transparent and efficient business professional. A colleague of mine was convinced that Cox &amp; Kings would benefit significantly with Mr Keki Mistry on its board. This alone acted as a primary trigger for my colleague to investigate the stock further. Upon further research, my colleague happily invested in Cox &amp; Kings Limited. Good for my him, as I write this today I know he is sitting on a 200% gain</li>\n<li><strong>Circle of Competence – </strong>This is where you leverage your professional skills to identify stock ideas. This is a highly recommended technique for a newbie investor. This method requires you to identify stocks within your professional domain. For example, if you are a medical professional, your competence circle would be the healthcare industry. You will probably be a better person to understand that industry than a stockbroker or an equity research analyst. All you need to do is identify the listed companies in this space and pick the best based on your assessment. Likewise, if you are banker, you will probably know more about banks than the others do. So, leverage your circle of competence to pick your investments.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The point is that the trigger for investigating stocks may come from any source. In fact, as and when you feel a particular stock looks interesting, add it to your list. This list over time will be your ‘watch list’. An essential thing to note here is that a stock may not satisfy the checklist items at a particular time, however as the time progresses, as business dynamics change at some point, it may match up to the checklist. Hence, it is important to evaluate the stocks in your watch list from time to time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch12-title2.jpg\"><img alt=\"M3-Ch12-title2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1244\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"222\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/M3-Ch12-title21.jpg\" width=\"229\"/></a></p>\n<h2>12.3 – The Moat</h2>\n<p>After selecting a stock, one has to run the checklist to investigate the stock further. This is called “Investment due diligence”. The due diligence process is critical, and one has to ensure maximum attention is paid to every aspect of this exercise. I will shortly present a checklist that I think is reasonable. But before that, we need to talk about ‘The Moat’.</p>\n<p>Moat (or economic moat) is a term that was popularized by Warren Buffet. The term refers to the company’s competitive advantage (over its competitors). A company with a strong moat, ensures the company’s long term profits are safeguarded.  Of course, the company should not only have a moat, but it should also be sustainable over a long period of time. A company that possesses wider moat characteristics (such as better brand name, pricing power, and better market share) would be more sustainable. It would be difficult for the company’s rivals to eat away its market share.</p>\n<p>To understand moats, think of “Eicher Motors Limited”. Eicher Motors is a major Indian automobile manufacturer. It manufactures commercial vehicles along with the iconic Royal Enfield bikes. The Royal Enfield bikes enjoy a huge fan following both in India and outside India. It has a massive brand recall. Royal Enfield caters to a niche segment which is growing fast. Their bikes are not as expensive as the Harley Davidson nor are they as inexpensive as the TVS bikes. It would be tough for any company to enter this space and shake up or rattle the brand loyalty that Royal Enfield enjoys. In other words, displacing Eicher Motors from this sweet spot will require massive efforts from its competitors. This is one of Eicher Motors’ moat.</p>\n<p>Many companies exhibit such interesting moats. In fact, true wealth-creating companies have a sustainable moat as an underlying factor. Think about Infosys – the moat was labour arbitrage between US and India, Page Industries – the moat was manufacturing and distribution license of Jockey innerwear, Prestige Industries – the moat was manufacturing and selling pressure cookers, Gruh Finance Limited – the moat was small ticket size credits disbursed to a certain market segment…so on and so forth. Hence always invest in companies which have wider economic moats.</p>\n<h2>12.4 – Due Diligence</h2>\n<p>The equity research due diligence process involves the following stages –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Understanding the business – requires reading the annual reports</li>\n<li>Application of the checklist and</li>\n<li>Valuation – to estimate the intrinsic value of the business</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In <strong>stage 1,</strong> i.e., understanding<strong> the business, </strong>we dwell deep into the business to know the company inside out. We need to make a list of questions for which we need to find answers to. A good way to start would be by posting a fundamental question about the company – <strong>What business is the company involved in?</strong></p>\n<p>To find the answer, we do not go to Google and search, instead look for it in the company’s latest Annual Report or their website. This helps us understand what the company has to say about itself.</p>\n<p>When it comes to my own investing practice, I usually like to invest in companies where the competition is less, and there is very little government intervention. For example, when I decided to invest in PVR Cinemas, there were only 3 listed players in that space. PVR, INOX, and Cinemax. PVR and Cinemax merged, leaving just 2 listed companies in that space. However, there are a few new players who have entered this space now. Hence it is time for me to re-evaluate my investment thesis in PVR.</p>\n<p>Once we are comfortable knowing the business, we move to <strong>stage 2,</strong> i.e., applying<strong> the</strong> <strong>checklist. </strong>At this stage, we get some performance-related answers. Without much ado, here is the 10 point checklist that I think is good enough for a start –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Variable</th>\n<th>Comment</th>\n<th>What does it signify</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Gross Profit Margin (GPM)</td>\n<td>&gt; 20%</td>\n<td>Higher the margin, higher is the evidence of a sustainable moat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Revenue Growth</td>\n<td>In line with the gross profit growth</td>\n<td>Revenue growth should be in line with the profit growth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>EPS</td>\n<td>EPS should be consistent with the Net Profits</td>\n<td>If a company is diluting its equity, then it is not good for its shareholders</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Debt Level</td>\n<td>The company should not be highly leveraged</td>\n<td>High debt means the company is operating on high leverage. Plus the finance cost eats away the earnings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Inventory</td>\n<td>Applicable for manufacturing companies</td>\n<td>A growing inventory, along with a growing PAT margin is a good sign. Always check the inventory number of days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Sales vs Receivables</td>\n<td>Sales backed by receivables is not a great sign</td>\n<td>This signifies that the company is just pushing its products to show revenue growth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Cash flow from operations</td>\n<td>Has to be positive</td>\n<td>If the company is not generating cash from operations, then it indicates operating stress</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Return on Equity</td>\n<td>&gt;25%</td>\n<td>Higher the ROE, better it is for the investor, however, make sure you check the debt levels along with this</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Business Diversity</td>\n<td>1 or 2 simple business lines</td>\n<td>Avoid companies that have multiple business interests. Stick to companies that operate in 1 or 2 segments</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Subsidiary</td>\n<td>Not many</td>\n<td>If there are too many subsidiaries, it could sign the company siphoning off money. Be cautious while investing in such companies.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Lastly, a company could satisfy each point mentioned in the checklist above, but if the stock is not trading at the right price in the market, there is no point buying the stock. So how do we know if the stock is trading at the right price or not? Well, this is what we do in <strong>stage 3</strong>. We need to run a <strong>valuation exercise</strong> on the stock. The most popular valuation method is called the “<strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis</strong>”.</p>\n<p>Over the next few chapters, we will discuss the framework to go about formally researching the company. This is called “<strong>Equity Research</strong>”. The focus of our discussion on equity research will largely be on Stage 2 and 3, as I believe stage 1 involves reading up the annual report in a fairly detailed manner.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A stock idea can come from any source.\n<ul type=\"a\">\n<li>Circle of competence and General observation is a great way to start.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It is advisable to have a watch list which includes stocks that look interesting.</li>\n<li>Once a stock is identified, we should look for sustainable moats.</li>\n<li>The due diligence process involves understanding the business, running the checklist to understand its financial performance, and the valuation exercise.</li>\n<li>When it comes to an understanding the business, one should be completely thorough with the company’s business operation.</li>\n<li>The checklist should be improvised as and when the investor gains investment experience.</li>\n<li>The DCF method is one of the best techniques to identify the intrinsic value of the business</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>13.1 – What to expect?</h2>\n<p>Having set the context in the previous chapter, we will now develop a methodology for conducting a ‘limited resource’ equity research. The reason why I call it ‘limited resource’ is because you and I, as a retail investor, have access to just a few resources to conduct equity research. These resources are – internet, company annual report, and MS Excel. Whilst an Institution has access to human resource (analyst), access to company management, financial database (such as Bloomberg, Reuters, Factset etc.), industry reports etc. So my objective here is to demonstrate how one can better understand a company and its business with the limited resources at hand. Of course, we will do this exercise keeping the end objective in perspective, i.e., deciding whether to buy or not to buy a stock.</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the previous chapter, we will structure the equity research process in 3 stages-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Understanding the Business</li>\n<li>Application of the checklist</li>\n<li>Intrinsic Value estimation (Valuation) to understand the fair price of the stock</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each stage mentioned above has several steps within it. One must understand that there is no shortcut to this, and one must not compromise any of these steps.</p>\n<h2>13.2 – Stock Price vs Business Fundamentals</h2>\n<p>When we take up a company for research, the first step is to understand the business as much as possible. People often miss this crucial step and go directly into the stock price analysis. Well, just analyzing the stock price is great if you have a short term perspective. However, for long term investments, understanding the business is essential.</p>\n<p>Why is it important you may wonder? Well, the reason is simple: the more you know the company, the higher is your conviction to stay put with the investment, especially during bad times (aka bear markets). Remember, during bear markets, the prices react and not the business fundamentals. Understanding the company and its business well gives you the required conviction to reason why it makes sense to stay invested in the stock even though the market may think otherwise. They say bear markets creates value, so if you have a high conviction on the company, you should consider buying into the stock during bear markets and not really selling the stock. Needless to say, this is highly counter-intuitive, and it takes years of investment practice to internalize this fact.</p>\n<p>Anyway, moving ahead the best source to get information related to the business is the company’s website and its annual report. We need to study at least the last 5-year annual report to understand how it is evolving across business cycles.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch13-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1258\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-Ch13-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-Ch13-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-Ch13-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>13.3 – Understanding the Business</h2>\n<p>As a first step towards understanding the business, we need to make a list of questions we need to find answers to. Do note, the answers to all these questions can be found out by reading through the company’s annual report and website.</p>\n<p>Here are a bunch of questions that I think helps us in our quest to understand the business. I have discussed the rationale behind each question.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Question</th>\n<th>The rationale behind the question</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">What does the company do?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">To get a basic understanding of the business</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Who are its promoters? What are their backgrounds?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">To know the people behind the business. Sanity check to eliminate criminal background, intense political affiliation etc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">What do they manufacture (in case it is a manufacturing company)?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">To know their products better, helps us get a sense of the product’s demand-supply dynamics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">How many plants do they have and where are they located?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">To get a sense of their geographic presence. Also at times, their plants could be located in a  prime location, and  the value of such location could go off-balance sheet, making the company highly undervalued</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Are they running the plant in full capacity?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Gives us an idea on their operational abilities, demand for their products, and their positioning for future demand</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">What kind of raw material is required?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Helps us understand the dependency of the company. For example, the raw material could be regulated by Govt (like Coal) or the raw material needs to be imported either of which needs further investigation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Who are the company’s clients or end-users?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">By knowing the client base, we can get a sense of the sales cycle and efforts required to sell the company’s products</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Who are their competitors?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Helps in knowing the competitors. Too many competing companies means margin pressure. In such a case, the company has to do something innovative. Margins are higher if the company operates in – monopoly, duopoly, or oligopoly market structure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Who are the major shareholders of the company?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Besides the promoter and promoter group, it helps to know who else owns the company’s shares. If a highly successful investor holds the shares in the company, then it could be a good sign</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Do they plan to launch any new products?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Gives a sense of how ambitious and innovative the company is. While at the same time a company launching products outside their domain raises some red flags – is the company losing focus?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Do they plan to expand to different countries?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Same rationale as above</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">What is the revenue mix? Which product sells the most?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Helps us understand which segment (and therefore, the product) is contributing the most to revenue. This in turns helps us understand the drivers for future revenue growth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Do they operate under a heavy regulatory environment?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">This is both good and bad – Good because it acts a natural barrier from new competition to enter the market, bad because they are limited with choices when it comes to being innovative in the industry</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Who are their bankers, auditors?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Good to know, and to rule out the possibility of the companies associated with scandalous agencies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">How many employees do they have? Does the company have labour issues?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Gives us a sense of how labour-intensive the company’s operations are. Also, if the company requires a lot of people with a niche skillset, then this could be another red flag</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">What are the entry barriers for new participants to enter the industry?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Helps us understand how easy or difficult it is for new companies to enter the market and eat away the margins</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Is the company manufacturing products that can be easily replicated in a country with cheap labour?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">If yes, the company may be sitting on a time bomb – think about companies manufacturing computer hardware, mobile handsets, garments etc</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Does the company have too many subsidiaries?</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">If yes, you need to question why? Is it away for the company to siphon off funds?</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These questions are thought starters for understanding any company. In finding answers, you will automatically start posting new questions for which you will have to find answers to. It does not matter which company you are looking at if you follow this Q&amp;A framework. I’m very confident your understanding of the company would drastically increase. This is because the Q&amp;A process requires you to read and dig out so much information about the company that you will start getting a greater understanding of the company.</p>\n<p>Remember, this is the first step in the equity research process. If you find red flags (or something not right about the company) while discovering the answers, I would advise you to drop researching the company further irrespective of how attractive the business looks. In case of a red flag, there is no point proceeding to stage 2 of equity research.</p>\n<p>From my experience, I can tell you that stage 1 of equity research, i.e. ‘Understanding the Company’ takes about 15 hours. After going through this process, I usually try to summarize my thoughts on a single sheet of paper which would encapsulate all the important things I have discovered about the company. This information sheet has to be crisp and to the point. If I’m unable to achieve this, then it is clear that I do not know enough about the company. After going through stage 1, I proceed to stage 2 of equity research, which is “Application of Checklist”. Please do bear in mind the equity research stages are sequential and should follow the same order.</p>\n<p>We will now proceed to stage 2 of equity research. The best way to understand stage 2 is by actually implementing the checklist on a company.</p>\n<p>We have worked with Amara Raja Batteries Limited (ARBL) throughout this module. Hence I guess it makes sense to go ahead and evaluate the checklist on the same company. Do remember, the company may differ, but the equity research framework remains the same.</p>\n<p>As we proceed, a word of caution at this point – the discussion going forward will mainly revolve around ARBL as we will understand this company better. The idea here is not to showcase how good or bad ARBL is but instead illustrate a framework of what I perceive as a ‘fairly adequate’ equity research process.</p>\n<h2>13.4 – Application of checklist</h2>\n<p>Stage 1 of the equity research process helps us understand how, what, who, and why. It helps us develop a holistic view of the company. However, as they say – the proof of the pudding is in the eating; so no matter how attractive the business looks, the numbers of the company should also look attractive.</p>\n<p>The objective of the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage of equity research’s objective is to help us comprehend the numbers and actually evaluate if both the nature of the business and the business’s financial performance complement each other. If they do not complement each other, then clearly the company will not qualify as an investible grade.</p>\n<p>We looked at the checklist in the previous chapter; I’ll reproduce the same here for quick reference.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Variable</th>\n<th>Comment</th>\n<th>What does it signify</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Net Profit Growth</td>\n<td>In line with the gross profit growth</td>\n<td>Revenue growth should be in line with the profit growth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>EPS</td>\n<td>EPS should be consistent with the Net Profits</td>\n<td>If a company is diluting its equity, then it is not good for its shareholders</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Gross Profit Margin (GPM)</td>\n<td>&gt; 20%</td>\n<td>Higher the margin, higher is the evidence of a sustainable moat</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Debt Level</td>\n<td>The company should not be highly leveraged</td>\n<td>High debt means the company is operating on high leverage. Plus the finance cost eats away the earnings</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Inventory</td>\n<td>Applicable for manufacturing companies</td>\n<td>A growing inventory, along with a growing PAT margin is a good sign. Always check the inventory number of days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Sales vs Receivables</td>\n<td>Sales backed by receivables is not a great sign</td>\n<td>This signifies that the company is just pushing its products to show revenue growth</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Cash flow from operations</td>\n<td>Has to be positive</td>\n<td>If the company is not generating cash from operations, then it indicates operating stress</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Return on Equity</td>\n<td>&gt;25%</td>\n<td>Higher the ROE, better it is for the investor, however, make sure you check the debt levels along with this</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Let us go ahead and evaluate each of the checklist items on Amara Raja Batteries and see what the numbers are suggesting. First, we will look into the P&amp;L items – Gross Profit, Net Profit, and EPS of the company.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Revenue &amp; Pat Growth</strong></p>\n<p>The first sign of a company that may qualify as the investable grade is the rate at which it is growing. To evaluate the growth of the company, we need to check the revenue and PAT growth. We will evaluate growth from two perspectives –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Year on Year growth – this will give us a sense of progress the company makes every year. Do note; industries do go through cyclical shifts. From that perspective, if a company has a flat growth, it is ok. However, just make sure you check the competition and ensure the growth is a flat industry-wide.</li>\n<li>Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) – The CAGR gives us a sense of how the company is evolving and growing across business cycles. A good, investable grade company is usually the first company to overcome the shifts in business cycles. This will eventually reflect in a healthy CAGR.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I prefer to invest in growing (Revenue and PAT) companies over and above 15% on a CAGR basis.</p>\n<p>Let us see how ARBL fares here…</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>FY 09 -10</th>\n<th>FY 10-11</th>\n<th>FY 11-12</th>\n<th>FY 12 -13</th>\n<th>FY 13 – 14</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revenue (INR Crs)</td>\n<td>1481</td>\n<td>1769</td>\n<td>2392</td>\n<td>3005</td>\n<td>3482</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Revenue Growth</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>19.4%</td>\n<td>35.3%</td>\n<td>25.6%</td>\n<td>15.9%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PAT (INR Crs)</td>\n<td>167</td>\n<td>148</td>\n<td>215</td>\n<td>287</td>\n<td>367</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PAT Growth</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>(11.3%)</td>\n<td>45.2%</td>\n<td>33.3%</td>\n<td>27.8%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The 5-year CAGR revenue growth is 18.6%, and the 5-year CAGR PAT growth is 17.01%. These are an interesting set of numbers; they qualify as a healthy set of numbers. However, we still need to evaluate the other numbers on the checklist.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Earnings per Share (EPS)</strong></p>\n<p>The earnings per share represent the profitability on a per-share basis. The EPS and PAT growing at a similar rate indicate that the company does not dilute the earnings by issuing new shares, which is good for the existing shareholders. One can think of this as a reflection of the company’s management’s capabilities.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>FV Rs.1</th>\n<th>FY 09 -10</th>\n<th>FY 10-11</th>\n<th>FY 11-12</th>\n<th>FY 12 -13</th>\n<th>FY 13 – 14</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EPS (In INR)</td>\n<td>19.56</td>\n<td>17.34</td>\n<td>12.59</td>\n<td>16.78</td>\n<td>21.51</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Share Cap(INR Crs)</td>\n<td>17.08</td>\n<td>17.08</td>\n<td>17.08</td>\n<td>17.08</td>\n<td>17.08</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EPS Growth</td>\n<td>  –</td>\n<td>-11.35%</td>\n<td> – 27.39%</td>\n<td>33.28%</td>\n<td>28.18%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The 5 year EPS CAGR stands at 1.90% for the FY14.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Gross Profit margins</strong></p>\n<p>Gross profit margins, expressed as a percentage is calculated as a –</p>\n<p><strong>Gross Profits / Net Sales</strong></p>\n<p>Where,</p>\n<p>Gross Profits = [Net Sales – Cost of Goods Sold]</p>\n<p>Cost of goods sold is the cost involved in making the finished good; we had discussed this calculation while understanding the inventory turnover ratio. Let us proceed to check how ARBL’s Gross Profit margins have evolved over the years.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>In INR Crs, unless indicated.</th>\n<th>FY 09-10</th>\n<th>FY 10-11</th>\n<th>FY 11-12</th>\n<th>FY 12 -13</th>\n<th>FY 13 – 14</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net Sales</td>\n<td>1464</td>\n<td>1757</td>\n<td>2359</td>\n<td>2944</td>\n<td>3404</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>COGS</td>\n<td>1014</td>\n<td>1266</td>\n<td>1682</td>\n<td>2159</td>\n<td>2450</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gross Profits</td>\n<td>450</td>\n<td>491</td>\n<td>677</td>\n<td>785</td>\n<td>954</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gross Profit Margins</td>\n<td>30.7%</td>\n<td>27.9%</td>\n<td>28.7%</td>\n<td>26.7%</td>\n<td>28.0%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Clearly, the Gross Profit Margins (GPM) looks very impressive. The checklist mandates a minimum GPM of 20%. ARBL has much more than the minimum GPM requirement. This implies a couple of things –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ARBL enjoys a premium spot in the market structure. This may be because of the absence of competition in the sector, which enables a few companies to enjoy higher margins</li>\n<li>Good operational efficiency, which in turn is a reflection of management’s capabilities</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Debt level – Balance Sheet check</strong></p>\n<p>The first three points in the checklist were mainly related to the company’s Profit &amp; Loss statement. We will now look through a few Balance sheet items. One of the most important line items that we need to look at on the Balance Sheet is the Debt. An increasingly high level of debt indicates a high degree of financial leverage. Growth at the cost of financial leverage is quite dangerous. Also do remember, a large debt on balance sheets means a large financial cost charge. This eats into the retained earnings of the firm.</p>\n<p>Here is how the debt stands for ARBL –</p>\n<p>Debt( INR Crs) Evaluation –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>FY 09-10</th>\n<th>FY 10-11</th>\n<th>FY 11-12</th>\n<th>FY 12 -13</th>\n<th>FY 13 – 14</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Debt</td>\n<td>91.19</td>\n<td>95.04</td>\n<td>84.07</td>\n<td>87.17</td>\n<td>84.28</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>EBIT</td>\n<td>261</td>\n<td>223</td>\n<td>321</td>\n<td>431</td>\n<td>541</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Debt/EBIT (%)</td>\n<td>35%</td>\n<td>42.61%</td>\n<td>26.19%</td>\n<td>20.22%</td>\n<td>15.57%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The debt seems to have stabilized around 85Crs. In fact, it is encouraging to see that the debt has come down in comparison to FY 09-10. Besides checking for the interest coverage ratio (which we have discussed previously), I also like to check the debt as a per cent of ‘Earnings before interest and taxes’ (EBIT). This just gives a quick perspective on how the company is managing its finance. We can see that the Debt/EBIT ratio has consistently reduced.</p>\n<p>I personally think ARBL has done a good job here by managing its debt level efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Inventory Check</strong></p>\n<p>Checking for the inventory data makes sense only if the company under consideration is a manufacturing company. Scrutinizing the inventory data helps us in multiple ways –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Raising inventory with raising PAT indicates are signs of a growing company</li>\n<li>A stable inventory number of days indicates management’s operational efficiency to some extent</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let us see how ARBL fares on the inventory data –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>FY 09-10</th>\n<th>FY 10-11</th>\n<th>FY 11-12</th>\n<th>FY 12 -13</th>\n<th>FY 13 – 14</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inventory (INR Crs)</td>\n<td>217.6</td>\n<td>284.7</td>\n<td>266.6</td>\n<td>292.9</td>\n<td>335.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inventory Days</td>\n<td>68</td>\n<td>72</td>\n<td>60</td>\n<td>47</td>\n<td>47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PAT (INR Crs)</td>\n<td>167</td>\n<td>148</td>\n<td>215</td>\n<td>287</td>\n<td>367</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The inventory number of days is more or less stable. In fact, it does show some sign of a slight decline. Do note; we have discussed the calculation of the inventory number of days in the previous chapter. Both the inventory and PAT are showing a similar growth sign which is again a good sign.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Sales vs Receivables</strong></p>\n<p>We now look at the sales number in conjunction with the receivables of the company. A sale backed by receivables is not an encouraging sign. It signifies credit sales, and therefore many questions arise out of it. For instance – are the company sales personal force selling products on credit? Is the company offering attractive (but not sustainable) credit to suppliers to push sales?</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>FY 09-10</th>\n<th>FY 10-11</th>\n<th>FY 11-12</th>\n<th>FY 12 -13</th>\n<th>FY 13 – 14</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net Sales(INR Crs)</td>\n<td>1464</td>\n<td>1758</td>\n<td>2360</td>\n<td>2944</td>\n<td>3403</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Receivables (INR Crs)</td>\n<td>242.3</td>\n<td>305.7</td>\n<td>319.7</td>\n<td>380.7</td>\n<td>452.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Receivables as a% of Net Sales</td>\n<td>16.5%</td>\n<td>17.4%</td>\n<td>13.5%</td>\n<td>12.9%</td>\n<td>13.3%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The company has shown stability here. From the table above we can conclude a large part of their sales is not really backed back receivables, which is quite encouraging. In fact, just like the inventory number of days, the receivables as % of net sales has also shown signs of a decline, which is quite impressive.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Cash flow from Operations</strong></p>\n<p>In fact, this is one of the most important checks one needs to run before deciding to invest in a company. The company should generate cash flows from operations; this is, in fact, where the proof of the pudding lies. A company which is draining cash from operations raises some sort of red flag.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>In INR Cr</th>\n<th>FY 09-10</th>\n<th>FY 10-11</th>\n<th>FY 11-12</th>\n<th>FY 12 -13</th>\n<th>FY 13 – 14</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cash flow from Operations</td>\n<td>214.2</td>\n<td>86.1</td>\n<td>298.4</td>\n<td>335.4</td>\n<td>278.7</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The cash flow from operations through a bit volatile has remained positive throughout the last 5 years. This only means ARBL’s core business operations are generating cash and therefore, can be considered successful.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Return on Equity</strong></p>\n<p>We have discussed at length about Return on Equity in chapter 9 of this module. I will encourage you to go through it again if you wish to refresh. Return on Equity (ROE) measures in percentage the return generated by the company keeping the shareholder’s equity in perspective. In a sense, ROE measures how successful the company’s promoters are for having invested their own funds in the company.</p>\n<p>Here is how ARBL’s ROE has fared for the last 5 years –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>In INR Cars</th>\n<th>FY 09-10</th>\n<th>FY 10-11</th>\n<th>FY 11-12</th>\n<th>FY 12 -13</th>\n<th>FY 13 – 14</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>PAT</td>\n<td>167</td>\n<td>148</td>\n<td>215</td>\n<td>287</td>\n<td>367</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shareholders’ Equity</td>\n<td>543.6</td>\n<td>645.7</td>\n<td>823.5</td>\n<td>1059.8</td>\n<td>1362.7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ROE</td>\n<td>30.7%</td>\n<td>22.9%</td>\n<td>26.1%</td>\n<td>27.1%</td>\n<td>27.0%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These numbers are awe-inspiring. I personally like to invest in companies that have an ROE of over 20%. Do remember, in case of ARBL, the debt is quite low. Hence the good set of return on equity numbers is not backed by excessive financial leverage, which is again highly desirable.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Remember, we are in stage 2 of equity research. I see ARBL qualifying quite well on almost all the required parameters in stage 2. As an equity research analyst, you have to view the output of stage 2 in conjunction with your finding from stage 1 (which deals with understanding the business). If you can develop a comfortable opinion (based on facts) after these 2 stages, the business surely appears to have investable grade attributes and therefore worth investing.</p>\n<p>However, before you buy the stock, you need to ensure the price is right. This is exactly what we do in stage 3 of equity research.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>‘Limited Resource’ Equity Research can be performed in 3 stages\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Understanding the Business</li>\n<li>Application of the checklist</li>\n<li>Valuations</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The objective of stage 1, i.e. understanding the business requires us to gather all business information.

Stage 1 dealt with understanding the business, and stage 2 dealt with understanding the company’s financial performance. One can proceed to stage 3, only if he is convinced with both the earlier stages’ findings. Stage 3 deals with the stock price valuation.</p>\n<p>An investment is considered a great investment only if a great business is bought at a great price. In fact, I would even stretch to say that it is wonderful to buy a mediocre business, as long as you are buying it at a great price. This only shows the significance of ‘the price’ when it comes to investing.</p>\n<p>The objective of the next two chapters is to help you understand “the price”. A valuation technique can estimate the price of a stock. Valuation per se helps you determine the ‘intrinsic value’ of the company. We use a valuation technique called the “<strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)</strong>” method to calculate the company’s intrinsic value. The intrinsic value as per the DCF method is evaluating the ‘perceived stock price’ of a company, keeping all the future cash flows in perspective.</p>\n<p>The DCF model is made up of several concepts which are interwoven with one another. Naturally, we need to understand each of these concepts individually and then place it in the context of DCF.  In this chapter we will understand the core concept of DCF called “The Net Present Value (NPV)”, and then we will proceed to understand the other concepts involved in DCF, before understanding the DCF as a whole.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch14-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1283\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-Ch14-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-Ch14-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-Ch14-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>14.2 – The future cash flow</h2>\n<p>The concept of future cash flow is the crux of the DCF model. We will understand this with the help of a simple example.</p>\n<p>Assume Vishal is a pizza vendor who serves the best pizzas in town. His passion for baking pizzas leads him to innovation. He invents an automatic pizza maker which automatically bakes pizzas. All he has to do is, pour the ingredients required for making a pizza in the slots provided and within 5 minutes a fresh pizza pops out. He figures out that with this machine, he can earn annual revenue of Rs.500,000/- and the machine has a life span of 10 years.</p>\n<p>His friend George is very impressed with Vishal’s pizza machine. So much so that, George offers to buy this machine from Vishal.</p>\n<p>Here is a question for you – What do you think is the minimum price that George should pay Vishal to buy this machine? Obviously, to answer this question, we need to see how economically useful this machine will be for George. Assuming he buys this machine today (2014), over the next 10 years, the machine will earn him Rs.500,000/- each year.</p>\n<p>Here is how George’s cash flow in the future looks like –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>2015</th>\n<th>2016</th>\n<th>2017</th>\n<th>2018</th>\n<th>2019</th>\n<th>2020</th>\n<th>2021</th>\n<th>2022</th>\n<th>2023</th>\n<th>2024</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>500,000</td>\n<td>500,000</td>\n<td>500,000</td>\n<td>500,000</td>\n<td>500,000</td>\n<td>500,000</td>\n<td>500,000</td>\n<td>500,000</td>\n<td>500,000</td>\n<td>500,000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I was hoping you could do note, for the sake of convenience, I have assumed the machine will start generating cash starting from 2015.</p>\n<p>Clearly, George will earn Rs.50,00,000/- (10 x 500,000) over the next 10 years, after which the machine is worthless. One thing is clear at this stage, whatever is the cost of this machine, it cannot cost more than Rs.50,00,000/-. Think about it – Does it make sense to pay an entity a price which is more than the economic benefit it offers?</p>\n<p>To go ahead with our calculation, assume Vishal asks George to pay “Rs. X” towards the machine. At this stage, assume George has two options – either pay Rs. X and buy the machine or invest the same Rs—x in a fixed deposit scheme that guarantees his capital and pays him an interest of 8.5%. Let us assume that George decides to buy the machine instead of the fixed deposit alternative. This implies, George has foregone an opportunity to earn 8.5% risk-free interest. This is the ‘opportunity cost’ for having decided to buy the machine.</p>\n<p>So far, in our quest to price the automatic pizza maker we have deduced three crucial bits of information –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The total cash flow from the pizza maker over the next 10 years – Rs.50,00,000/-</li>\n<li>Since the total cash flow is known, it also implies that the machine’s cost should be less than the total cash flow from the machine.</li>\n<li>The opportunity cost for buying the pizza machine is an investment option that earns 8.5% interest.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keeping the above three points in perspective, let us move ahead. We will now focus on cash flows. We know that George will earn Rs.500,000/- every year from the machine for the next 10 years. So think about this – George in 2014, is looking at the future –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How much is the Rs.500,000/- that he receives in 2016 worth in today’s terms?</li>\n<li>How much is the Rs.500,000/- that he receives in 2018 worth in today’s terms?</li>\n<li>How much is the Rs.500,000/- that he receives in 2020 worth in today’s terms?</li>\n<li><strong>To generalize, how much is the cash flow of the future worth in today’s terms?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The answer to these questions lies in the realms of the “<strong>Time value of money</strong>”. In simpler words, if I can calculate the value of all the future cash flows from that machine in terms of today’s value, then I would be in a better situation to price that machine.</p>\n<p>Please note that we will digress/move away from the pizza problem in the next section, but we will eventually get back to it.</p>\n<h2>14.3 – Time Value of Money (TMV)</h2>\n<p>Time value of money plays an extremely crucial role in finance. The TMV finds its application in almost all the financial concepts. Be it discounted cash flow analysis, financial derivatives pricing, project finance, calculation of annuities etc., the time value of money is applicable. Think of the ‘Time value of money’ as the car engine, with the car itself being the “Financial World”.</p>\n<p>The concept of the time value of money revolves around the fact that money does not remain the same across time. Meaning, the value of Rs.100 today is not really Rs.100, 2 years from now. Inversely, the value of Rs.100, 2 years from now is not really Rs.100 as of today. Whenever there is the passage of time, there is an element of opportunity. Money has to be accounted (adjusted) for that opportunity.</p>\n<p>If we have to evaluate, what would be the value of money that we have today sometime in the future, then we need to move the ‘money today’ through the future. This is called the “<strong>Future Value (FV)</strong>” of the money.  Likewise, if we have to evaluate the value of money that we are expected to receive in the future in today’s terms, then we have to move the future money back to today’s terms. This is called the “<strong>Present Value (PV)</strong>” of money.</p>\n<p>In both cases, as there is a passage of time, the money must be adjusted for the opportunity cost. This adjustment is called “Compounding” when we have to calculate the future value of money. It is called “Discounting” when we have to calculate the present value of money.</p>\n<p>Without getting into the mathematics involved (which is really simple) I will give you the formula required to calculate the FV and PV.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1</strong> – How much is Rs.5000/- in today’s terms (2014) worth five years later assuming an opportunity cost of 8.5%?</p>\n<p>This is a case of Future Value (FV) computation, as we are trying to evaluate the future value of the money that we have today –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Future Value = Amount * (1+ opportunity cost rate) ^ Number of years</strong>.</p>\n<p>= 5000 *(1 + 8.5%) ^ 5</p>\n<p>= 7518.3</p>\n<p>This means Rs.5000 today is comparable with Rs.7518.3 after 5 years, assuming an opportunity cost of 8.5%.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 2</strong> – How much is Rs.10,000/- receivable after 6 years, worth in today’s terms assuming an opportunity cost of 8.5%?</p>\n<p>This is clearly the case of Present Value (PV) computation as we are trying to evaluate the present value of cash receivable in future in terms of today’s value.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">Present Value = Amount / (1+Discount Rate) ^ Number of years</strong></p>\n<p>= 10,000 / (1+ 8.5% ) ^ 6</p>\n<p>= 6129.5</p>\n<p>This means Rs.10,000/- receivable after 6 years in future is comparable to  Rs.6,129.5 in today’s terms assuming a discount rate of 8.5%.</p>\n<p><strong>Example 3</strong> – If I reframe the question in the first example – How much is Rs.7518.3 receivable in 5 years worth in today’s terms given an opportunity cost @ 8.5%?</p>\n<p>We know this requires us to calculate the present value. Also, since we have done the reverse of this in example 1, we know the answer should be Rs.5000/-. Let us calculate the present value to check this –</p>\n<p>= 7518.3 / (1 + 8.5%) ^ 5</p>\n<p>= 5000.0</p>\n<p>Assuming you are clear with the concept of the time value of money, I guess we are now equipped to go back to the pizza problem.</p>\n<h2>14.4 – The Net Present Value of cash flows</h2>\n<p>We are still in the process of evaluating the price of the pizza machine. We know George is entitled to receive a stream of cash flows (under owning the pizza machine) in the future.

The NPV, in this case, is Rs.<strong> 32,80,842</strong> This also means, the value of all the future cash flows from the pizza machine in today’s terms is Rs.<strong> 32,80,842</strong>. If George has to buy the pizza machine from Vishal, he has to ensure the price is Rs.<strong> 32,80,842</strong> or lesser, but definitely not more than that and this is roughly how much the pizza machine should cost George.</p>\n<p>Now, think about this – What if we replace the pizza machine with a company?

NPV plays a vital role in the DCF valuation model. Having understood this concept, we now need to understand a few other related topics to the DCF valuation model. In fact, we will learn more about these concepts by implementing the DCF model on Amara Raja Batteries Limited (ARBL). With this, we will conclude the 3<sup>rd</sup> stage of Equity Research, i.e. ‘The Valuation’.</p>\n<p>In the previous chapter, to evaluate the pizza machine’s price, we looked at the future cash flows from the pizza machine and discounted them back to get the present value. We added all the present value of future cash flows to get the NPV. Towards the end of the previous chapter, we also toyed with the idea –What will happen if the company’s stock replaces the pizza machine? In that case, we just need an estimate of the future cash flows from the company, and we will be able to price the company’s stock.</p>\n<p>But what cash flow are we talking about? And how do we forecast the future cash flow for a company?</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M3-Ch15-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1300\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-Ch15-title1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-Ch15-title1.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-Ch15-title1-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>15.1 – The Free Cash Flow (FCF)</h2>\n<p>We need to consider the cash flow for the DCF Analysis is called the “<strong>Free Cash flow (FCF)</strong>” of the company. The free cash flow is basically the excess operating cash that the company generates after accounting for capital expenditures such as buying land, building and equipment. This is the cash that shareholders enjoy after accounting for the capital expenditures. The mark of a healthy business eventually depends on how much free cash it can generate.</p>\n<p>Thus, free cash is the amount of cash the company is left with after paying all its expenses, including investments.</p>\n<p>When the company has free cash flows, it indicates the company is healthy.  Hence investors often look out for such companies whose share prices are undervalued but who have high or rising free cash flow, as they believe over time, the disparity will disappear as the share price will soon increase.</p>\n<p>Thus the Free cash flow helps us know if the company has generated earnings in a year or not. Hence as an investor to assess the company’s true financial health, look at the free cash flow besides the earnings.</p>\n<p>FCF for any company can be calculated easily by looking at the cash flow statement. The formula is –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\">FCF = Cash from Operating Activities – Capital Expenditures</strong></p>\n<p>Let us calculate the FCF for the last 3 financial years for ARBL –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Particular</th>\n<th>2011 -12</th>\n<th>2012 -13</th>\n<th>2013 -14</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cash from Operating Activities (after income tax)</td>\n<td>Rs.296.28 Cars</td>\n<td>Rs.335.46</td>\n<td>Rs.278.7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Capital Expenditures</td>\n<td>Rs.86.58</td>\n<td>Rs.72.47</td>\n<td>Rs.330.3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n<td>Free Cash Flow (FCF)</td>\n<td>Rs.209.7</td>\n<td>Rs.262.99</td>\n<td>(Rs.51.6)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Here is the snapshot of ARBL’s FY14 annual report from where you can calculate the free cash flow –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-ch15-chart1.jpg\"><img alt=\"M3-ch15-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1302\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"374\" sizes=\"(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-ch15-chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-ch15-chart1.jpg 625w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-ch15-chart1-284x300.jpg 284w\" width=\"354\"/></a></p>\n<p>Please note, the Net cash from operating activities is computed after adjusting for income tax. The net cash from operating activities is highlighted in green, and the capital expenditure is highlighted in red.</p>\n<p>You may now have a fair point in your mind  – When the idea is to calculate the future free cash flow, why are we calculating the historical free cash flow? The reason is simple while working on the DCF model; we need to predict the future free cash flow. The best way to predict the future free cash flow is by estimating the historical average free cash flow and then sequentially growing the free cash flow by a certain rate… This is a standard practice in the industry.</p>\n<p>Now, by how much do we grow, the free cash flow is the next big question? Well, the growth rate you would assume should be as conservative as possible. I personally like to estimate the FCF for at least 10 years. I do this by growing the cash flow at a certain rate for the first 5 years, and then I factor in a lower rate for the next five years. If you are getting a little confused here,  I will encourage you to go through the following step by step calculation for better clarity.</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\"><strong>Step 1</strong> – Estimate the average free cash flow.</span></p>\n<p>As the first step, I estimate the average cash flow for the last 3 years for ARBL –</p>\n<p>= 209.7 + 262.99 + (51.6) / 3</p>\n<p>=<strong>Rs.140.36  Crs</strong></p>\n<p>The reason for taking the average cash flow for the last 3 years is to ensure we are averaging out extreme cash flows and accounting for the business’s cyclical nature. For example, in ARBL, the latest year cash flow is negative at Rs.51.6 Crs. Clearly, this is not a true representation of ARBL’s cash flow; hence, for this reason, it is always advisable to take the average free cash flow figures.</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\"><strong>Step 2</strong> – Identify the growth rate.</span></p>\n<p>Select a rate which you think is reasonable. This is the rate at which the average cash flow will grow going forward.  I usually prefer to grow the FCF in 2 stages. The first stage deals with the first 5 years, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage deals with the last 5 years. Specifically, concerning ARBL, I prefer to use 18% for the first 5 years and around 10% for the next five years. If the company under consideration is a mature company that has grown to a certain size (as in a large-cap company), I would prefer to use a growth rate of 15% and 10%, respectively. The idea here is to be as conservative as possible.</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #eacf32;\"><strong>Step 3</strong> – Estimate the future cash flows.</span></p>\n<p>We know the average cash flow for 2013 -14 is Rs.140.26 Crs. At 18% growth, the cash flow for the year 2014 – 2015 is estimated to be –</p>\n<p>= 140.36 * (1+18%)</p>\n<p>= Rs. 165.62 Crs.</p>\n<p>The free cash flow for the year 2015 – 2016 is estimated to be –</p>\n<p>165.62 * (1 + 18%)</p>\n<p>= Rs. 195.43 Crs.</p>\n<p>So on and so forth. Here is a table that gives the detailed calculation…</p>\n<p><strong>An estimate of future cash flow –</strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th>Growth rate assumed</th>\n<th>Future Cash flow (INR Crs)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>2014 – 15</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>165.62</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>2015 – 16</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>195.43</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>2016 – 17</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>230.61</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>2017 – 18</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>272.12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>2018 – 19</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>321.10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td>2019 – 20</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>353.21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td>2020 – 21</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>388.53</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td>2021 – 22</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>427.38</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td>2022 – 23</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>470.11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>2023 – 24</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>517.12</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>With this, we now have a fair estimate of the future free cash flow. How reliable are these numbers, you may ask? After all, predicting the free cash flow implies predicting the sales, expenses, business cycles, and literally every aspect of the business. Well, the estimate of the future cash flow is just that; it is an estimate. The trick here is to be as conservative as possible while assuming the free cash flow growth rate. We have assumed 18% and 10% growth rate for the future; these are fairly conservative growth rate numbers for a well managed and growing company.</p>\n<h2>15.2 – The Terminal Value</h2>\n<p>We have tried to predict the future free cash flow for upto 10 years. But what would happen to the company after the 10<sup>th</sup> year? Would it cease to exist? Well, it would not. A company is expected to be a ‘going concern’ which continues to exist forever. This also means that as long as the company exists, some amount of free cash is generated. However, as companies mature, the rate at which free cash is generated starts to diminish.</p>\n<p>The rate at which the free cash flow grows beyond 10 years (2024 onwards) is called the “<strong>Terminal Growth Rate</strong>”. Usually, the terminal growth rate is considered to be less than 5%. I personally like to set this rate between 3-4%, and never beyond that.</p>\n<p>The <strong>“Terminal Value”</strong> is the sum of all the future free cash flow beyond the 10<sup>th</sup> year, also called the terminal year. To calculate the terminal value, we just have to take the cash flow of the 10<sup>th</sup> year and grow it at the terminal growth rate. However, the formula to do this is different as we are calculating the value literally to infinity.</p>\n<p><strong>Terminal Value = FCF * (1 + Terminal Growth Rate) / (Discount Rate – Terminal growth rate)</strong></p>\n<p>Do note, the FCF used in the terminal value calculation is that of the 10<sup>th</sup> year. Let us calculate the terminal value for ARBL considering a discount rate of 9% and terminal growth rate of 3.5% :</p>\n<p>= 517.12 *(1+ 3.5%) / (9% – 3.5%)</p>\n<p>= <strong>Rs.9731.25 Crs</strong></p>\n<h2>15.3 – The Net Present Value (NPV)</h2>\n<p>We know the future free cash flow for the next 10 years, and we also know the terminal value (which is the future free cash flow of ARBL beyond the 10<sup>th</sup> year and upto infinity). We now need to find out the value of these cash flows in today’s terms. As you may recall, this is the present value calculation. Once we find out the present value, we will add these present values to estimate the net present value (NPV) of ARBL.</p>\n<p>We will assume the discount rate at 9%.</p>\n<p>For example, in 2015 – 16 (2 years from now), ARBL is expected to receive Rs.195.29 Crs. At a 9% discount rate, the present value would be –</p>\n<p>= 195.29 / (1+9%)^2</p>\n<p>= Rs.164.37 Crs</p>\n<p>So here is how the present value of the future cash flows stack up –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Year</th>\n<th>Growth rate</th>\n<th>Future Cash flow (INR Crs)</th>\n<th>Present Value (INR Crs)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2014 – 15</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>165.62</td>\n<td>151.94</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2015 – 16</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>195.29</td>\n<td>164.37</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2016 – 17</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>230.45</td>\n<td>177.94</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2017 – 18</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>271.93</td>\n<td>192.72</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2018 – 19</td>\n<td>18%</td>\n<td>320.88</td>\n<td>208.63</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>2019 – 20</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>352.96</td>\n<td>210.54</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>2020 – 21</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>388.26</td>\n<td>212.48</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>2021 – 22</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>427.09</td>\n<td>214.43</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>2022 – 23</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>470.11</td>\n<td>216.55</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>2023 – 24</td>\n<td>10%</td>\n<td>517.12</td>\n<td>218.54</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"4\">Net Present Value (NPV) of future free cash flows</td>\n<td>Rs.1968.14 Crs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Along with this, we also need to calculate the net present value for the terminal value. To calculate this, we simply discount the terminal value by discount rate –</p>\n<p>= 9731.25 / (1+9%)^10</p>\n<p>= Rs.4110.69 Crs</p>\n<p>Therefore, the sum of the present values of the cash flows is = NPV of future free cash flows + PV of terminal value</p>\n<p>= 1968.14 + 4110.69</p>\n<p>= Rs.6078.83 Crs</p>\n<p>This means standing today and looking into the future; I expect ARBL to generate a totally free cash flow of Rs.6078.83 Crs, all of which would belong to the shareholders of ARBL.</p>\n<h2>15.4 – The Share Price</h2>\n<p>We are now at the very last step of the DCF analysis. We will now calculate the share price of ARBL based on the firm’s future free cash flow.</p>\n<p>We now know the total free cash flow that ARBL is likely to generate. We also know the number of shares outstanding in the markets. Dividing the total free cash flow by the total number of shares would give us the per-share price of ARBL.</p>\n<p>However, before doing that, we need to calculate the value of ‘Net Debt’ from its balance sheet. Net debt is the current year total debt minus current year cash &amp; cash balance.</p>\n<p><strong>Net Debt = Current Year Total Debt – Cash &amp; Cash Balance.</strong></p>\n<p>For ARBL, this would be (based on the FY14 Balance sheet) –</p>\n<p>Net Debt  = 75.94 – 294.5</p>\n<p>= (Rs.218.6 Crs)</p>\n<p>A negative sign indicates that the company has more cash than debt. This naturally has to be added to the total present value of free cash flows.</p>\n<p>= Rs.6078.83 Crs – (Rs. 218.6 Crs)</p>\n<p>= Rs.6297.43 Crs</p>\n<p>Dividing the above number by the total number of shares should give us the company’s share price, also called the intrinsic value of the company.</p>\n<p><strong>Share Price = Total Present Value of Free Cash flow / Total Number of shares.</strong></p>\n<p>We know from ARBL’s annual report the total number of outstanding shares is 17.081 Crs. Hence the intrinsic value or the per-share value is –</p>\n<p>= Rs.6297.43 Crs / 17.081 Crs</p>\n<p><strong>~ Rs.368 per share!</strong></p>\n<p>This, in fact, is the final output of the DCF model.</p>\n<h2>15.5 – Modeling Error &amp; the intrinsic value band</h2>\n<p>The DCF model though quite scientific, is built on a bunch of assumptions. Making assumptions, especially in finance, takes on an art form. You get better at it as you progress through and gain more experience. Hence, we should assume (yet another assumption ) that we have made a few errors while making the intrinsic value calculation for all practical purposes. Hence, we should accommodate for modelling errors.</p>\n<p>A leeway for the modelling error simply allows us to be flexible with calculating the per-share value. I personally prefer to add + 10% as an upper band and – 10% as the lower band for what I perceive as the stock’s intrinsic value.</p>\n<p>Applying that on our calculation –</p>\n<p>Lower intrinsic value = 368 * (1- 10%) = Rs. 331</p>\n<p>Upper intrinsic value = Rs.405</p>\n<p>Hence, instead of assuming Rs.368 as the stock’s fair value, I would now assume that the stock is fairly valued between 331 and 405. This would be the intrinsic value band.</p>\n<p>Now keeping this value in perspective, we check the market value of the stock. Based on its current market price, we conclude the following –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the stock price is below the lower intrinsic value band, we consider the stock to be undervalued. Hence one should look at buying the stock.</li>\n<li>If the stock price is within the intrinsic value band, then the stock is considered fairly valued. While no fresh buy is advisable, one can continue to hold on to the stock if not adding more to the existing positions.</li>\n<li>If the stock price is above the higher intrinsic value band, the stock is considered overvalued. The investor can either book profits at these levels or continue to stay put. But should certainly not buy at these levels.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keeping these guidelines, we could check for Amara Raja Batteries Limited’s stock price as of today (2<sup>nd</sup> Dec 2014).

Active trading, on the other hand, is like the fast bullet train.  When long term value opportunity is created, the opportunity lingers in the market for a while. It does not really disappear in a hurry. For instance, we now know that Amara Raja Batteries Limited is overvalued at the current market price. It is trading way higher than the upper limit of the intrinsic value band. But the scene was totally different a year ago. Recall based on FY 2013- 2014, ARBL’s intrinsic value band is between Rs. 331 and Rs.405.</p>\n<p>Here is the chart of ARBL –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-ch15-chart31.jpg\"><img alt=\"M3-ch15-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1331\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"277\" sizes=\"(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-ch15-chart31.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-ch15-chart31.jpg 468w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/M3-ch15-chart31-300x178.jpg 300w\" width=\"468\"/></a></p>\n<p>The blue highlight clearly shows that the stock was comfortable trading within the band for almost 5 months! You could have bought the stock anytime during the year. After buying, all you had to do was stay put for the returns to roll!</p>\n<p>In fact, this is the reason why they say – Bear markets create value. The whole of last year (2013), the markets were bearish, creating valuable buying opportunities in quality stocks.</p>\n<h2>15.7 – Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Over the last 3 chapters, we have looked at different aspects of equity research. As you may have realized, equity research is simply the process of inspecting the company from three different perspectives (stages).</p>\n<p>In stage 1, we looked at the qualitative aspects of the company. At this stage, we figured out who, what, when, how, and why of the company. I consider this an extremely crucial stage of equity research. If something is not really convincing here, I do not proceed further. Remember, markets are an ocean of opportunities, so do not force yourself to commit to an opportunity that does not give you the right vibe.</p>\n<p>I proceed to stage 2 only after I am 100% convinced with my findings in stage 1. Stage 2 is basically the application of the standard checklist, where we evaluate the company’s performance. The checklist that we have discussed is just my version of what I think is a fairly good checklist. I would encourage you to build your own checklist, but make sure you have a reasonable logic while including each checklist item.</p>\n<p>Assuming the company clears both stage 1 and 2 of equity research, I proceed to equity research stage 3. In stage 3, we evaluate the stock’s intrinsic value and compare it with the market value. If the stock is trading cheaper than the intrinsic value, then it is considered a good buy. Else it is not.</p>\n<p>When all the 3 stages align to your satisfaction, you certainly would have the conviction to own the stock. Once you buy, stay put, ignore the daily volatility (that is, in fact, the virtue of capital markets) and let the markets take its own course.</p>\n<p>Please note, I have included a DCF Model on ARBL, which I have built on excel. You could <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Module-3_Chapter-15_DCF-Model.xlsx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>download</strong></a> this and use it as a calculator for other companies as well.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The free cash flow (FCF) for the company is calculated by deducting the capital expenditures from the net cash from operating activates.</li>\n<li>The free cash flow tracks the money left over for the investors.</li>\n<li>The latest year FCF is used to forecast the future year’s cash flow.</li>\n<li>The growth rate at which the FCF is grown has to be conservative.</li>\n<li>The terminal growth rate is when the company’s cash flow is supposed to grow beyond the terminal year.</li>\n<li>The terminal value is the value of the company’s cash flow from the terminal year upto infinity.</li>\n<li>The future cash flow, including the terminal value, has to be discounted back to today’s value.</li>\n<li>The sum of all the discounted cash flows (including the terminal value) is the total net present value of cash flows.</li>\n<li>From the total net present value of cash flows, the net debt has to be adjusted. Dividing this by the total number of shares gives us the per-share value of the company.</li>\n<li>One needs to accommodate for modelling errors by including a 10% band around the share price.</li>\n<li>By including a 10% leeway, we create an intrinsic value band.</li>\n<li>Stock trading below the range is considered a good buy, while the stock price above the intrinsic value band is considered expensive.</li>\n<li>Wealth is created by long term ownership of undervalued stocks.</li>\n<li>Thus, the DCF analysis helps the investors identify whether the company’s current share price is justified.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

We learned about the intrinsic value calculation using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis in the previous chapter. The DCF method is probably one of the most reliable methods available to evaluate a company’s stock’s intrinsic value. However, the DCF method has its fair share of drawbacks which you need to be aware of. The DCF model is only as good as the assumptions which are fed to it. If the assumptions used are incorrect, the fair value and stock price computation could be skewed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>DCF requires us to forecast</strong> – To begin with, the DCF model requires us to predict the future cash flow and the business cycles. This is a challenge, let alone for a fundamental analyst and the top management of the company.</li>\n<li><strong>Highly sensitive to the Terminal Growth rate</strong> – The DCF model is susceptible to the terminal growth rate. A small change in the terminal growth rate would lead to a large difference in the final output, i.e. the per-share value. For instance, in the ARBL case, we have assumed 3.5% as the terminal growth rate. At 3.5%, the share price is Rs.368/- but if we change this to 4.0% (an increase of 50 basis points), the share price will change to Rs.394/-</li>\n<li><strong>Constant Updates </strong>– Once the model is built, the analyst needs to constantly modify and align the model with new data (quarterly and yearly data) that comes in. Both the inputs and the assumptions of the DCF model needs to be updated regularly.</li>\n<li><strong>Long term focus – </strong>DCF is heavily focused on long term investing, and thus it does not offer anything to investors who have a short term focus. (i.e. 1-year investment horizon)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The DCF model may also make you miss out on unusual opportunities as the model is based on certain rigid parameters.</p>\n<p>Having stated the above, the only way to overcome the drawbacks of the DCF Model is by being as conservative as possible while making the assumptions. Some guidelines for the conservative assumptions are –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>FCF (Free Cash Flow) growth rate</strong> – The rate at which you grow the FCF year on year has to be around 20%. Companies can barely sustain growing their free cash flow beyond 20%. If a company is young and belongs to the high growth sector, then probably a little under 20% is justified, but no company deserves an FCF growth rate of over 20%</li>\n<li><strong>Some years </strong>– This is a bit tricky, while longer the duration, the better it is. At the same time, longer the duration, there would be more room for errors. I generally prefer to use a 10 year 2 stage DCF approach</li>\n<li><strong>2 stage DCF valuation</strong> – It is always good to split the DCF analysis into 2 stages, as demonstrated in the previous chapter’s ARBL example. As discussed, In stage 1, I would grow the FCF at a certain rate, and in stage 2, I would grow the FCF at a rate lower than the one used in stage 1</li>\n<li><strong>Terminal Growth Rate</strong> – As I mentioned earlier, the DCF model is susceptible to terminal growth. The simple thumb rule here – keep it as low as possible. I personally prefer to keep it around 4% and never beyond it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>16.2 – Margin of Safety</h2>\n<p>Now, despite making some conservative assumptions, things could still go wrong. How do you insulate yourself against that? This is where the concept of ‘Margin of Safety’ would arrive. The margin of safety thought process was popularized by Benjamin Graham in his seminal book titled “Intelligent Investor”. The ‘margin of safety’ suggests that an investor should buy stocks only when available at a discount to the estimated intrinsic value calculation. Following the Margin of Safety does not imply successful investments but would provide a buffer for calculation errors.</p>\n<p>Here is how I exercise the ‘Margin of Safety’ principle in my own investment practice. Consider Amara Raja Batteries Limited; the intrinsic value estimate was around Rs.368/- per share. Further, we applied a 10% modelling error to create the intrinsic value band. The lower intrinsic value estimate was Rs.331/-. At Rs.331/- we are factoring in modelling errors. The Margin of Safety advocates us to discount the intrinsic value further. I usually like to discount the intrinsic value by another 30% at least.</p>\n<p>But why should we discount it further? Aren’t we extra conservative, you may ask? Yes, but this is the only way you can insulate yourself from the bad assumptions and bad luck. Think about it, given all the fundamentals, if a stock looks attractive at Rs.100, then at Rs.70, you can be certain it is indeed a good bet! This is, in fact, what the savvy value investors always practice.</p>\n<p>Going back to the case of ARBL –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Intrinsic value is Rs.368/-</li>\n<li>Accounting for modelling errors @10%, the lower intrinsic band value is Rs.331/-</li>\n<li>Discounting it further by another 30%, to accommodate for the margin of safety, the intrinsic value would be around Rs.230/-</li>\n<li>At 230/- I would be a buyer in this stock with great conviction.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When quality stocks fall way below its intrinsic value, they get picked up by value investors. Hence when the margin of safety is at play, you should consider buying it as soon as you can. As a long term investor, sweet deals like this (as in a quality stock trading below its intrinsic value) should not be missed.</p>\n<p>Also, remember good stocks will be available at great discounts, mostly in a bear market when people are extremely pessimistic about stocks. So make sure you have sufficient cash during bear markets to go shopping!</p>\n<h2>16.3 – When to sell?</h2>\n<p>Throughout the module, we have discussed buying stocks. But what about selling? When do we book profits? For instance, assume you bought ARBL at around Rs.250 per share. It is now trading close to Rs.730/- per share. This translates to an absolute return of 192%. A great return rate by any yardstick (considering the return is generated in over a year). So does that mean you actually sell out this stock and book a profit? Well, the decision to sell depends on the disruption in investible grade attributes.</p>\n<p><strong>Disruption in investible grade attributes</strong> – Remember, the decision to buy the stock does not stem from the stock trades’ price. Meaning, we do not buy ARBL just because it has declined by 15%. We buy ARBL only because it qualifies through the rigour of the“investible grade attributes”. Suppose a stock does not showcase investible grade attributes; we do not buy. Therefore going by that logic, we hold on to stocks as long as the investible grade attributes stay intact.</p>\n<p>The company can continue to showcase the same attributes for years together. The point is, as long as the attributes are intact, we stay invested in the stock. Under these attributes, the stock price naturally increases, thereby creating wealth for you. The moment these attributes shows signs of crumbling down, one can consider selling the stock.</p>\n<h2>16.4 – How many stocks in the portfolio?</h2>\n<p>The number of stocks that you need to own in your portfolio is often debated. While holding many stocks helps you diversify risk, others say holding far fewer helps you take concentrated bets, which can potentially reap great rewards. Here is what some of the legendary investors have advised when it comes to the number of stocks in your portfolio –</p>\n<p>Seth Klarman – 10 to 15 stocks</p>\n<p>Warren Buffet – 5 to 10 stocks</p>\n<p>Ben Graham – 10 to 30 stocks</p>\n<p>John Keynes – 2 to 3 stocks</p>\n<p>I have about 13 stocks in my own personal portfolio, and at no point, I would be comfortable owning beyond 15 stocks. While it is hard to comment on the minimum number of stocks, I believe there is no point in owning a large number of stocks in your portfolio. When I say large, I have a figure of over 20 in my mind.</p>\n<h2>16.5 – Final Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Over the last 16 chapters, we have learnt and discussed several topics related to the markets and fundamental analysis. Perhaps it is now the right time to wrap up and leave you with a few last points that I think are worth remembering –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Be reasonable</strong> – Markets are volatile; it is the nature of the beast. However, if you have the patience to stay put, markets can reward you fairly well. When I say “reward you fairly well”, I have a CAGR of about 15-18% in mind. I personally think this is a fairly decent and realistic expectation. Please don’t be swayed by abnormal returns like 50- 100% in the short term; even if it is achievable, it may not be sustainable</li>\n<li><strong>Long term approach </strong>– I have discussed this topic in chapter 2 to why investors need to have a long term approach. Remember, money compounds faster the longer you stay invested</li>\n<li><strong>Look for investible grade attributes </strong>– Look for stocks that display investible grade attributes and stay invested in them as long as these attributes last. Book profits when you think the company no longer has these attributes</li>\n<li><strong>Respect Qualitative Research</strong> – Character is more important than numbers. Always look at investing in companies whose promoters exhibit good character</li>\n<li><strong>Cut the noise and apply the checklist </strong>– No matter how much the analyst on TV/newspaper brags about a certain company, doesn’t fall prey to it. You have a checklist; apply the same to see if it makes any sense</li>\n<li><strong>Respect the margin of safety </strong>– As this literally works like a safety net against bad luck</li>\n<li><strong>IPO’s </strong>– Avoid buying into IPOs. IPOs are usually overpriced. However, if you were compelled to buy into an IPO, then analyze the IPO in the same 3 stage equity research methodology</li>\n<li><strong>Continued Learning </strong>– Understanding markets requires a lifetime effort. Always look at learning new things and exploring your knowledge base.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I want to leave you with 4 book recommendations that will help you develop a great investment mindset.</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8126543604/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=3626&amp;creative=24790&amp;creativeASIN=8126543604&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=safanive-21\">The Essays of Warren Buffet: Lessons for Investors &amp; Managers </a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.in/Little-Still-Market-Books-Profits/dp/0470624159/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417777231&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+little+book+that+beats+the+market\">The Little Book that Beats the Market – By Joel Greenblatt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.in/Little-Book-Valuation-Company-Profits/dp/1118004779/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417777349&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+little+book+on+valuation\">The Little Book of Valuations – By Aswath Damodaran</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.in/Little-Book-That-Builds-Wealth/dp/047022651X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417777561&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+little+book+that+builds+wealth\">The Little Book that Builds Wealth – By Pat Dorsey</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>So friends, with these points, I would like to close this module on Fundamental Analysis.

The underlying asset can be anything a stock, bond, commodity or currency. The financial derivatives have been around for a long time now. The earliest reference to the application of derivatives in India dates back to 320 BC in ‘Kautilya’s Arthashastra’. It is believed that in the ancient Arthashastra (study of Economics) script, Kautilya described the pricing mechanism of the standing crops ready to be harvested at some point in the future. Apparently, he used this method to pay the farmers much in advance, thereby structuring a true ‘forwards contract’.</p>\n<p>Given the similarities between the forwards and the futures market, I think the best possible way to introduce the futures market is by first understanding the ‘Forwards market’. The Understanding of Forwards Market would lay a strong foundation for learning the Futures Market.</p>\n<p>The forwards’ contract is the simplest form of derivative. Consider the forwards’ contract as the older avatar of the futures contract. Both the futures and the forward contracts share a common transactional structure, except that the futures contracts have become the trader’s default choice over the years. The forward contracts are still in use but are limited to a few participants, such as the industries and banks. The focus of this chapter is to help you understand the structure of a typical forwards transaction, after which we will break it down into its elements and understand its advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<h2>1.2 – A simple Forwards example</h2>\n<p>The Forward market was primarily started to protect the interest of the farmers from adverse price movements. In a forward market, the buyer and seller agree to exchange the goods for cash. The exchange happens at a specific price on a specific future date. The goods’ price is fixed by both the parties on the day they agree. Similarly, the date and time of the goods to be delivered is also fixed. The agreement happens face to face with no intervention from a third party. This is called “Over the Counter or OTC” agreement. Forward contracts are traded only in the OTC (Over the Counter) market, where individuals/ institutions trade through negotiations on a one to one basis.</p>\n<p>Consider this example; there are two parties involved here.</p>\n<p>One is a jeweller whose job is to design and manufacture jewellery. Let us call him ‘ABC Jewelers’. The other is a gold importer whose job is to sell gold at a wholesale price to jewellers. Let us call him’ XYZ Gold Dealers’.</p>\n<p>On 9<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, ABC agreed with XYZ to buy 15 kilograms of gold at a certain purity (say 999 purity) in three months (9<sup>th</sup> March 2015). They fix the price of gold at the current market price, which is Rs.2450/- per gram or Rs.24,50,000/- per kilogram. Hence as per this agreement, on 9<sup>th</sup> March 2015, ABC is expected to pay XYZ a sum of Rs.3.675 Crs (24,50,000/Kg*15) in return for the 15 kgs of Gold.</p>\n<p>This is a very straightforward and typical business agreement that is prevalent in the market. An agreement of this sort is called a ‘Forwards Contract’ or a ‘Forwards Agreement’.</p>\n<p>Do note; the agreement is executed on 9<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, irrespective of the price of gold 3 months later, i.e. 9<sup>th</sup> March 2015, both ABC and XYZ are obligated to honour the agreement. Before we proceed further, let us understand each party’s thought process and understand what compelled them to enter this agreement.</p>\n<p>Why do think ABC entered into this agreement? Well, ABC believes the price of gold would go up over the next 3 months; hence they would want to lock in today’s market price for the gold. Clearly, ABC wants to insulate itself from an adverse increase in gold prices.</p>\n<p>In a forwards contract, the party agreeing to buy the asset at some point in the future is called the “Buyer of the Forwards Contract”; in this case, it is ABC Jewelers.</p>\n<p>Likewise, XYZ believes the price of gold would go down over the next 3 months, and hence they want to cash in on the high price of gold available in the market today. In a forwards contract, the party agreeing to sell the asset at some point in the future is called the “Seller of the Forwards Contract”, in this case, it is XYZ Gold Dealers.</p>\n<p>Both the parties have an opposing view on gold; hence they see this agreement to be in line with their future expectation.</p>\n<h2>1.3 – 3 possible scenarios</h2>\n<p>While both these parties have their own view on gold, only three possible scenarios could pan out at the end of 3 months. Let us understand these scenarios and how they could impact both the parties.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Scenario 1 – The price of gold goes higher.</span></p>\n<p>Assume on 9<sup>th</sup> March 2015, the price of gold (999 purity) is trading at Rs.2700/- per gram. Clearly, ABC Jeweler’s view on the gold price has come true. At the time of the agreement, the deal was valued at Rs 3.67 Crs, but now, with the increase in Gold prices, the deal is valued at Rs.4.05 Crs. As per the agreement, ABC Jewelers is entitled to buy Gold (999 purity) from XYZ Gold Dealers at a price they had previously agreed upon, i.e. Rs.2450/- per gram.</p>\n<p>The increase in Gold price impacts both the parties in the following way –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Party</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n<th>Financial Impact</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ABC Jewelers</td>\n<td>Buys gold from XYZ Gold Dealers @ Rs.2450/- per gram</td>\n<td>ABC saves Rs.38 Lakhs ( 4.05 Crs – 3.67 Crs) by this agreement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>XYZ Gold Dealers</td>\n<td>Obligated to sell Gold to ABC @ Rs.2450/- per gram</td>\n<td>Incurs a financial loss of Rs.38 Lakhs.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Hence, XYZ Gold Dealers will have to buy Gold from the open market at Rs.2700/- per gram and sell it to ABC Jewelers at the rate of Rs.2450/- per gram, thereby facing a loss in this transaction.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Scenario 2 – The price of gold goes down.</span></p>\n<p>Assume on 9<sup>th</sup> March 2015, the price of gold (999 purity) is trading at Rs.2050/- per gram. Under such circumstances, XYZ Gold Dealers view on the gold price has come true. At the time of the agreement, the deal was valued at Rs 3.67 Cr, but now, with the decrease in gold prices, the deal is valued at Rs.3.075 Cr. However, according to the agreement, ABC Jewelers is obligated to buy Gold (999 purity) from XYZ Gold Dealers at a price they had previously agreed upon, i.e. Rs.2450/- per gram.</p>\n<p>This decrease in the gold price would impact both the parties in the following way –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Party</th>\n<th>Action</th>\n<th>Financial Impact</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ABC Jewelers</td>\n<td>Is obligated to buy gold from XYZ Gold Dealers @ Rs.2450/- per gram</td>\n<td>ABC loses Rs.59.5 Lakhs ( 3.67 Crs – 3.075 Crs) under this agreement</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>XYZ Gold Dealers</td>\n<td>Entitled to sell Gold to ABC @ Rs.2450/- per gram</td>\n<td>XYZ enjoys a profit of Rs.59.5 Lakhs.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Even though Gold is available at a much cheaper rate in the open market, ABC Jewelers is forced to buy gold at a higher rate from XYZ Gold Dealers hence incurring a loss.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Scenario 3 – The price of Gold stays the same.</span></p>\n<p>If on 9<sup>th</sup> March 2015, the price is the same as on 9<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, then neither ABC nor XYZ would benefit from the agreement.</p>\n<h2>1.4 – 3 possible scenarios in one graph</h2>\n<p>Here is a visual representation of the impact of gold prices on ABC Jewelers –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch1-chart1.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch1-chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1410\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"282\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch1-chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch1-chart1.jpg 500w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch1-chart1-300x169.jpg 300w\" width=\"500\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see from the chart above, at Rs.2450/- per gram, there is no financial impact for ABC. However, as per the graph above, we can notice that ABC’s financials are significantly impacted by a directional movement in the gold prices. Higher the price of gold (above Rs.2450/-), higher is ABC’s savings or the potential profit. Likewise, as and when the gold price lowers (below Rs.2450/-), ABC is obligated to buy gold at a higher rate from XYZ, thereby incurring a loss.</p>\n<p>Similar observations can be made with XYZ –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch1-chart2.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch1-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1411\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"281\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch1-chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch1-chart2.jpg 500w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch1-chart2-300x169.jpg 300w\" width=\"500\"/></a></p>\n<p>At Rs.2450/- per gram, there is no financial impact on XYZ. However, as per the graph above, XYZ’s financials are significantly impacted by a directional movement in the gold prices. As and when the price of gold increases (above Rs.2450/-), XYZ is forced to sell gold at a lower rate, thereby incurring a loss. However, as and when the price of gold decreases (below Rs.2450/-), XYZ would enjoy the benefit of selling gold at a higher rate, at a time when gold is available at a lower rate in the market, thereby making a profit.</p>\n<h2>1.5– A quick note on settlement</h2>\n<p>Assume that on 9<sup>th</sup> March 2015, the price of Gold is Rs.2700/- per gram. Clearly, as we have just understood, at Rs.2700/- per gram, ABC Jewelers stands to benefit from the agreement. At the time of the agreement (9<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014), 15 Kgs gold was worth Rs. 3.67Crs, as of 9<sup>th</sup> March 2015, 15 kgs Gold is valued at Rs.4.05 Crs. Assuming at the end of 3 months, i.e. 9<sup>th</sup> March 2015, both the parties honour the contract, here are two options available to them for settling the agreement –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Physical Settlement</strong> – – The buyer of a forward contract pays the full purchase price, and the seller delivers the actual asset. XYZ buys 15 Kgs of gold from the open market by paying Rs.4.05Crs and would deliver the same to ABC on the receipt of Rs.3.67 Crs. This is called a physical settlement</li>\n<li><strong>Cash Settlement</strong> – In a cash settlement, there is no actual delivery or receipt of security. In cash settlement, the buyer and the seller will exchange the cash difference. As per the agreement, XYZ is obligated to sell Gold at Rs.2450/- per gram to ABC. In other words, ABC pays Rs.3.67 Crs in return for the 15 Kgs of Gold which is worth Rs.4.05Cr in the open market. However, instead of making this transaction, i.e. ABC paying Rs.3.67 Crs in return for the gold worth Rs.4.05Crs, the two parties can agree to exchange only the <strong>cash differential</strong>. In this case, it would be Rs.4.05 Crs – Rs.3.67 Crs = Rs.38 Lakhs. Hence XYZ would pay Rs.38 lakhs to ABC and settle the deal. This is called a cash settlement</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will understand a lot more about the settlement at a much later stage. Still, at this stage, you need to be aware that there are basically two basic types of settlement options available in a Forwards Contract – physical and cash.</p>\n<h2>1.6 – What about the risk?</h2>\n<p>While we are clear about the structure (terms and conditions) of the agreement and the impact of the price variation on either party, what about the risk involved? Do note, the risk is not just with price movements, there are other major drawbacks in a forward contract, and they are–</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Liquidity Risk</strong> – In our example, we have conveniently assumed that ABC finds a party XYZ who has an exact opposite view with a certain view on gold. Hence they easily strike a deal. In the real world, this is not so easy. In a real-life situation, the parties would approach an investment bank and discuss their intention. The investment bank would scout the market to find a party who has an opposite view. Of course, the investment bank does this for a fee.</li>\n<li><strong>Default Risk/ / Counterparty risk – </strong>Consider this, assume the gold prices have reached Rs.2700/- at the end of 3 months. ABC would feel proud of the financial decision they had taken 3 months ago. They are expecting XYZ to pay up. But what if XYZ defaults?</li>\n<li><strong>Regulatory Risk – </strong>The Forwards contract agreement is executed by mutual consent of the parties involved, and there is no regulatory authority governing the agreement. In the absence of a regulatory authority, a sense of lawlessness creeps in, which in turn increases the incentive to default.</li>\n<li><strong>Rigidity – </strong>Both ABC and XZY entered into this agreement on 9<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014 with a certain gold view. However, what would happen if their view would strongly change when they are halfway through the agreement? The rigidity of the forward agreement is such that they cannot foreclose the agreement halfway through.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The forward contracts have a few disadvantages, and hence future contracts were designed to reduce the risks of the forward agreements.</p>\n<p>In India, the Futures Market is a part of a highly vibrant Financial Derivatives Market. During the course of this module, we will learn more about the Futures and methods to trade this instrument efficiently!</p>\n<p>So, let’s hit the road!</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The forwards’ contract lays down the basic foundation for a futures contract.</li>\n<li>A Forward is an OTC derivative, which is not traded on an exchange.</li>\n<li>Forward contracts are private agreements whose terms vary from one contract to the other.</li>\n<li>The structure of a forwards contract is fairly simple.</li>\n<li>In a forward agreement, the party agreeing to buy the asset is called the “Buyer of the Forwards Contract.”</li>\n<li>In a forward agreement, the party agreeing to sell the asset is called the “Seller of the Forwards Contract.”</li>\n<li>A variation in the price would impact both the buyer and the seller of the forwards’ contract.</li>\n<li>Settlement takes place in two ways in a forward contract – Physical and Cash settlement.</li>\n<li>A futures contract reduces the risk of a forward contract.</li>\n<li>The core of a forward and futures contract is the same.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>2.1 – Setting the context</h2>\n<p>In the previous chapter, we looked at a straightforward Forwards Contract example, where two parties agreed to exchange cash for goods at some point in the future. We inspected the structure of the transaction and understood how the variation in price impacts the parties involved. Towards the end of the chapter, we had listed down 4 key risks (or issues) concerning the forward’s contracts, and we concluded that a futures contract is structured to overcome the critical risks of a forward agreement, namely –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Liquidity risk</li>\n<li>Default Risk</li>\n<li>Regulatory Risk</li>\n<li>The rigidity of the transitional structure</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will continue referring to the same example in this chapter as well. Hence you may want to refresh your understanding of the example quoted in the previous chapter.</p>\n<p>From the previous chapter, one thing is quite clear – <strong>If you view the price of an asset, you can benefit significantly by entering into a forward agreement</strong>. All one needs to do is to find a counterparty willing to take the opposite side. Needless to say, a forward agreement is limited by the inherent risks involved, all of which is overcome by a futures agreement.</p>\n<p>The Futures contract or Futures Agreement is an improvisation of the Forwards Agreement. The Futures Contract is designed so that it retains the core transactional structure of a Forwards Market. At the same time, it eliminates the risks associated with the forward’s contract. A Forward Agreement would give you a financial benefit as long as you have an accurate directional view of an asset’s price; this is what I mean when I say ‘core transactional structure’.</p>\n<p>This may seem a bit absurd but think about it – the ‘transaction structure’ of an old generation car was to transport you from point ‘A’ to point ‘B’. However, the new generation car comes with improvisations in terms of the safety features – airbags, seat belts, ABS, power steering etc… However, it still retains the core ‘transaction structure’, i.e. to help you move from point ‘A’ to point ‘B’. This is the same distinction between the forwards and the futures agreement.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M4-Ch2-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1417\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch2-title1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch2-title1.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch2-title1-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>2.2 – A sneak peek into the Futures Agreement</h2>\n<p>As we now know, the core transactional structure of the futures and forwards is the same, and I guess it makes sense to look into the features that distinguish the Futures from the forwards. We will have a quick sneak peek into these features in this chapter, but we will dig into each feature in greater detail at a later stage.</p>\n<p>Recall, in the example we had quoted in the previous chapter, ABC jeweller agrees with XYZ to buy a certain quantity of gold at a certain point in the future. Now imagine this, what if ABC found it really hard to find XYZ as a counterparty to the agreement? Under such circumstances, though ABC has a certain view on gold and is also willing to enter into a financial agreement, they would be left helpless because there is no counterparty to take the opposite side of the agreement.</p>\n<p>Now further, imagine this. What if ABC, instead of spending its time and effort to scout for a counterparty, decides to walk into a financial supermarket where many counterparties are willing to take the opposite view. With such a financial supermarket in place, ABC has to announce its intention, and the willing counterparties would line up to take the opposing stance. What more, a true financial supermarket of this sort would not just have people with a view on gold, but instead will also have people with a view on Silver, Copper, Crude oil, and pretty much any asset class, including stocks!</p>\n<p>In fact, this is exactly how the Futures Contracts are made available. They are available and accessible to all of us and not just available to a corporate such as ABC Jewelers. The futures contracts are available to us in the financial (super) market, often called the “Exchange”. The exchange can be a stock exchange or a commodity exchange.</p>\n<p>As we know, a futures contract is structured a little differently compared to a forwards contract. This is mainly to overcome the risks involved in the forwards market. Let us look at each of these points that differentiate the futures from the forward’s agreement.</p>\n<p>Note that you may still not be very clear about futures; that’s alright; keep the following points in perspective. We will shortly consider a futures example, and with that, you should be clear about how Futures agreement works.</p>\n<p><strong>Futures Contract mimics the underlying</strong> – In the example of ABC jewellers and XYZ Gold Dealers, the forwards’ agreement was based on gold (as an asset) and its price. However, when it comes to a Futures Contract, the agreement is based on the asset’s future price. The futures price mimics the asset, which is also called the underlying.  For example, gold as an asset can have a ‘Gold Futures’ contract. Please think of the underlying and its futures contract somewhat as twin siblings. Whatever the underlying asset does, the futures contract does the same. Therefore if the price of the underlying goes up, the futures contract’s price would also go up. Likewise, if the price of the underlying goes down, the futures contract’s price also goes down.</p>\n<p><strong>Standardized Contracts</strong> – Again, going back to the example of ABC jewellers and XYZ Gold Dealers, the agreement was to deal with 15 kgs of gold of certain purity. If both the parties mutually agreed, the agreement could have been for 14.5Kgs, or 15.25 Kgs or whatever they would think is convenient for them. However, in the futures contract, the parameters are standardized. They are not negotiable.</p>\n<p><strong>Futures Contracts are tradable</strong> – The futures contract is easily tradable. If I get into an agreement with a counterparty, unlike a forward contract, I need not honour the contract until the end (also called the expiry day). At any point in time, if my view changes, I can transfer the contract to someone else and get out of the agreement.</p>\n<p><strong>Futures Market is highly regulated – A regulatory authority highly regulates the Futures markets (or, for that matter, the entire financial derivatives market)</strong>. In India, the regulatory authority is “Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)”. This means there is always someone overlooking the activities in the market and making sure things run smoothly. This also means default on a futures agreement is hardly a possibility.</p>\n<p><strong>Futures Contracts are time-bound </strong>– We will understand this point in detail a bit later, but for now, remember that all the futures contracts available to you have different time frames. In the example from the previous chapter, ABC jewellers had a certain view on gold, keeping 3 months in perspective. If ABC were to do a similar agreement in the futures market, contracts would be available to them in the 1 month, 2 months, and 3-month time frame. The time frame upto which the contract lasts is called ‘The expiry of the contract.</p>\n<p><strong>Cash settled –</strong> Most of the futures contracts are cash-settled. This means only the cash differential is paid out. There is no worry of moving the physical asset from one place to another. The cash settlement is overseen by the regulatory authority ensuring total transparency in the cash settlement process.</p>\n<p>To sum up, here is a table that quickly summarizes the difference between the “Forwards Contract” and “Futures Contract.”</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Forwards Contract</th>\n<th>Futures Contract</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contracts are traded over the counter (OTC)</td>\n<td>Futures Contract are traded in the exchange.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contracts can be customized.</td>\n<td>Future Contracts are standardized.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High counterparty risk</td>\n<td>No counterparty risk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Not regulated</td>\n<td>Regulated by SEBI (in India)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contracts are not transferable.</td>\n<td>Transferable hence easily tradable</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Time-bound to just 1-time frame</td>\n<td>Multiple time frame contracts available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>The settlement is flexible (physical or cash)</td>\n<td>Cash settled</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>At this stage, I feel there is a need to stress the distinction between the <strong>spot price</strong> and the <strong>futures price. </strong>The spot price is the price at which the asset trades in the ‘regular’ market, also called the ‘spot market’. For example, if we are talking about gold as an underlying, then there are two prices we are referring to – gold in the regular market called the Spot market and gold in the Futures market, called the Gold Futures. The spot market prices and futures market prices move in tandem, meaning if one goes up, the other also goes up.</p>\n<p>With these perspective points, let us now focus our attention on a few other futures contract nuances.</p>\n<h2>2.3 – Before your first futures trade</h2>\n<p>Before we dig deeper and understand the working of a futures contract, we need to understand a few other aspects of futures trading. Do remember at a later stage, we will revisit these points and discuss them in greater detail. But for now, good working knowledge on the following points is what is required.</p>\n<p><strong>Lot size – </strong>Future is a standardized contract where everything related to the agreement is pre-determined. The lot size is one such parameter. Lot size specifies the minimum quantity that you will have to transact in a futures contract. Lot size varies from one asset to another.</p>\n<p><strong>Contract Value </strong>– In our example of ABC jeweller and XYZ Gold Dealers, ABC agreed to buy 15 kgs of Gold at the rate of Rs.2450/- per gram or Rs.24,50,000/- per kilogram. Since the deal was to buy 15 kgs, the whole deal was valued at Rs.24,50,000 x 15 = Rs.3.675 Crs. In this case, it is said that the contract Value’ is Rs.3.675 Crs. Simply put, the contract value is the quantity of the price of the asset. We know the futures agreement has a standard pre-determined minimum quantity (lot size). The contract value of a futures agreement can be generalized to <strong>“Lot size x Price”.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Margin – </strong>Again, referring back to the example of ABC jeweller and XYZ Gold Dealers at the time of the agreement, i.e. on 9<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, both the parties would have had a gentleman’s word and nothing beyond that. Meaning both the parties would have just agreed to honour the contract on the agreement’s expiry day, i.e. 9<sup>th</sup> March 2015. Do notice there is <strong>no</strong> exchange of money on 9<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014.</p>\n<p>However, in a futures agreement, the moment a transaction occurs, both the parties involved will have to deposit some money. Consider this as the token advance required for agreeing. The money has to be deposited with the broker. Usually, the money that needs to be deposited is calculated as a % of the contract value. This is called the margin amount’. Margins play a pivotal role in futures trading; we will understand this in greater detail later. For now, remember that to enter into a futures agreement, a margin amount is required, which is a certain percentage of the contract value.</p>\n<p><strong>Expiry – </strong>As we know, all futures contracts are time-bound. The expiry or the expiry date of the futures contract is the date upto which the agreement is valid. Beyond the valid date, the contract ceases to exist. Also, be aware that the day a contract expires, the exchanges introduce new contracts.</p>\n<p>With these few points that we have discussed so far, I guess we can now understand a simple example of futures trading.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Key takeaways from this chapter</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The forwards and futures markets give you a financial benefit if you have an accurate directional view of an asset’s price.</li>\n<li>The Futures contract is an improvisation over the Forwards contract.</li>\n<li>The Futures price generally mimics the underlying price in the spot market.</li>\n<li>Unlike a forwards contract, the futures contract is tradable.</li>\n<li>The futures contract is a standardized contract wherein all the variables of the agreement is predetermined.</li>\n<li>Futures contracts are time-bound, and the contracts are available over different timeframes.</li>\n<li>Most of the futures contracts are cash-settled</li>\n<li>SEBI in India regulates the futures market.</li>\n<li>The lot size is the minimum quantity specified in the futures contract.</li>\n<li>Contract value = Lot size times the Futures price.</li>\n<li>To enter into a futures agreement, one has to deposit a margin amount, a certain % of the contract value.</li>\n<li>Every futures contract has an expiry date beyond which the contract would seize to exist.

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>3.1 – Before the Trade</h2>\n<p>In the last chapter, we learnt various concepts related to the futures market. <strong>Remember, the motivation for any trader entering into a futures agreement is to benefit financially. The trader needs to have a directional view of the price of the underlying asset</strong>. Perhaps it is time we take up a practical example of a futures trade to demonstrate how this is done. Let us move away from the Gold example and look into an example related to the stocks.</p>\n<p>Today (15<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) management, a leading Indian Software Company, had investors meet, wherein the TCS management announced that they are cautious about the revenue growth for the December Quarter.  The markets do not like such cautious statements, especially from the company’s management. After the statement, the markets reacted to it, and as we can see from the TCS’s spot market quote, the stock went down by over 3.6%. In the snapshot below, the price per share is highlighted in blue. Ignore the red highlight; we will discuss it shortly.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image1_TCS.png\"><img alt=\"Image1_TCS\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1453\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"429\" sizes=\"(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image1_TCS.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image1_TCS.png 568w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image1_TCS-300x227.png 300w\" width=\"568\"/></a></p>\n<p>As a trader, I believe that the TCS stock price reaction to the management’s statement is exaggerated. Here is my rational – If you follow TCS or any Indian IT sector company in general, you will know that December is usually a lacklustre month for the Indian IT companies. December is the financial year-end in the US (the biggest market for the Indian IT companies) and the holiday season; hence the business moves quite slowly for such companies. This furlough has a significant impact on the IT sector revenues. This information is already known and factored in by the market. Hence, I believe the stock sinking by 3.6% is unwarranted.  I also feel this could be an opportunity to buy TCS, as I believe the stock price will eventually go up. Hence I would be a buyer in TCS after such an announcement.</p>\n<p>Notice, based on my thoughts (which I perceive as rational), I have developed a ‘<strong>directional view</strong>’ on the asset’s price (TCS). I believe the TCS (underlying asset) stock price will increase in due course of time from my analysis. In other words, I am bullish about TCS at the current market price.</p>\n<p>Instead of buying TCS shares in the spot market, I decide to buy the TCS Futures (for reasons I will discuss in the next chapter). Having decided to buy futures, all I need to see is the price at which the TCS Futures is trading. The contract details are readily available on the NSE’s website. In fact, the link to get details for a TCS futures contract is available on the spot market quotes. I have highlighted the same in red in the image above.</p>\n<p>Recall, the futures price should always mimic the spot price, meaning if the spot price has gone down, the futures price should also go down. Here is a snapshot from NSE’s website showing the TCS Futures price.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image2_TCS.png\"><img alt=\"Image2_TCS\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1454\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"482\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image2_TCS.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image2_TCS.png 569w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image2_TCS-300x254.png 300w\" width=\"569\"/></a></p>\n<p>As expected, the futures price has mimicked the spot price, and therefore the TCS Futures is also down by 3.77%. You may have two questions at this point –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>TCS in the spot market is down by 3.61%. However, TCS futures is down by 3.77%? Why the difference?</li>\n<li>TCS spot price is at Rs.2362.35, but Futures price is at Rs.2374.90? Why the difference?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both these are valid questions at this point, and the answer to these questions depends upon the “Futures Pricing Formula”, a topic we will deal with at a later point in time. But the most important point to note at this stage is that the futures price has moved in line with the spot price, and both of them are down for the day. Before we proceed any further, let us relook at the futures contract and inspect a few key elements. Allow me to repost the futures contract with a few important features highlighted.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image3_TCS.png\"><img alt=\"Image3_TCS\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1455\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"482\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image3_TCS.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image3_TCS.png 569w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image3_TCS-300x254.png 300w\" width=\"569\"/></a></p>\n<p>Starting from the top, the box highlighted in red has three important bits of information –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Instrument Type</strong> – Remember, the underlying asset is the stock of a company, and we are interested in the asset’s future contract. Hence, the instrument type here is the ‘stock futures.’</li>\n<li><strong>Symbol</strong> – This highlights the name of the stock, TCS in this case</li>\n<li><strong>Expiry Date</strong> – This is the date on which the contract ceases to exist. As we can see, the TCS futures contract specifies 24<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014 as the expiry. You may be interested to know that all derivative contracts in India expire on the last Thursday of the month. We will discuss more what happens on the expiry date at a later point.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We had looked at the blue box a little earlier; it just highlights the future price.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the black box highlights two important parameters – the underlying value and the market lot.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Underlying Value</strong> – This is the same as the price at which the underlying is trading in the spot market. We know TCS was trading at Rs.2362.35 per share; however, when I took the above snapshot, TCS fell by another few points. Hence the price we see here is Rs.2359.95. per share</li>\n<li><strong>Market lot (lot size) </strong>– Remember, a futures contract is a standardized contract. The parameters are prefixed. The lot size is the minimum number of shares that we need to buy/sell if we wish to agree. The lot size for the TCS futures is 125, which means a minimum of 125 shares (or a multiple of 125 shares) have to be transacted while trading the TCS futures.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the previous chapter, Recall discussed the ‘contract value’, which is ‘Lot size’ multiplied by the futures price. We can now calculate the contract value for TCS futures as follows–</p>\n<p>Contract Value = Lot size x Price of futures</p>\n<p>= 125 x Rs.2374.90</p>\n<p>= <strong>Rs. 296,862.5</strong></p>\n<p>Before we proceed to discuss the TCS futures trade, let us quickly look at another ‘Futures Contract’ to rivet our understanding so far. Here is the snapshot of the futures contract of ‘State Bank of India (SBI)’.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image4_SBI.png\"><img alt=\"Image4_SBI\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1456\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"489\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image4_SBI.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image4_SBI.png 569w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image4_SBI-300x258.png 300w\" width=\"569\"/></a></p>\n<p>With the help of the above snapshot, you can perhaps answer the following questions –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the instrument type?</li>\n<li>What is SBI’s futures price?</li>\n<li>How does SBI’s future price compare with its spot price?</li>\n<li>What is the expiry date of the Futures contract?</li>\n<li>What are the lot size and the contract value of SBI futures?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>3.2 – The Futures Trade</h2>\n<p>Going back to the TCS futures trade, the idea is to buy a futures contract as I expect the TCS stock price to go up. The price at which I would buy TCS Futures is Rs.2374.9/- per share. Remember, the minimum number of shares that I need to buy is 125. The minimum number of shares is also colloquially called ‘one lot’.</p>\n<p>So how do we buy the ‘Futures Contract’? This is quite simple we can call our broker and ask him to buy 1 lot of TCS futures at Rs.2374.9/- or we can buy it ourselves through the broker’s trading terminal.</p>\n<p>I prefer to place trades myself through the trading terminal. If you are new to the trading terminal, I suggest you read through the chapter on the <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-trading-terminal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Trading terminal.</strong></a> Once TCS Futures is loaded on my market watch, all I need to do is press F1 and buy the contract.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch3-title.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch3-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1416\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch3-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch3-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch3-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>The moment I press the F1 key (expressing my interest to buy TCS futures) on my trading terminal, a couple of things happen in the background.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Margin Validation</strong> – Remember, whenever we enter into a futures agreement, we need to deposit a margin amount (sort of a token advance), which is simply a percentage of the contract value. We will discuss margins shortly. If there is insufficient margin, we cannot agree. So as the first step, the broker’s risk management system/ software checks if I have sufficient money in my trading account (to suffice the margin requirement) to enter into a futures agreement.</li>\n<li><strong>The counterparty search</strong> – After validating the margins, the system scouts for a relevant counterparty match. The match has to be made between me – the buyer of the TCS futures and the TCS futures seller. Remember, the stock exchange is a ‘Financial supermarket’ where one can find many participants with different views on an asset’s price. The seller of TCS futures obviously thinks TCS futures price will go further down. Like my rationale as to why the TCS stock price will go higher, the seller has his own rationale for his directional view. Hence he wants to be a seller.</li>\n<li><strong>The signoff – </strong>Once Step 1 and 2 are through, i.e. the margin validation and finding the counterparty, the buyer and the seller digitally sign the futures agreement. This is mainly a symbolic process. By agreeing to buy (or sell) the futures agreement, one gives the other consent to honour the contract specifications.</li>\n<li><strong>The margin block –</strong> After the signoff is done, the required margin is blocked in our trading account. We cannot use the blocked margin for any other purpose. The money will be blocked as long as we hold the futures contract.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With the completion of these 4 steps, <strong>I now own 1 lot of TCS Futures Contract</strong>. You may be surprised to know, in the real markets, all the above-mentioned steps happen sequentially in a matter of a few seconds!</p>\n<p>Here is a critical question – What does it mean by “I now own 1 lot of TCS Futures Contract”? Well, it simply means by purchasing TCS futures on 15<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, I have digitally agreed with a certain counterparty agreeing to buy 125 TCS shares from me (the counterparty) at Rs.2374.9/- per share. This futures agreement between me and the counterparty expires on 24<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014.</p>\n<h2>3.3 –The 3 possible scenarios post the agreement</h2>\n<p>After agreeing, 3 possible scenarios can pan out by 24<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014. We know what these scenarios are (we studied them in chapter 1) – the price of TCS can go up, the price of TCS can come down, or the price of TCS could stay the same. Let us arbitrarily take up a few possible price situations and see the price’s impact on both the parties involved.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – TCS stock price goes up by 24<sup>th</sup> Dec.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a case where my directional view on TCS shares has come true. Therefore I stand to benefit.</p>\n<p>Assume on 24<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, the stock price of TCS has gone up from Rs.2374.9/- to Rs.2450/- per share; by the increase in the spot price, the futures price would also increase. This means, as per the agreement, I am entitled to buy the TCS shares at Rs.2374.9/- per share, which is a much lower price compared to what is available in the market. My profit will be Rs.75.1/- per share (Rs.2450 – Rs.2374.9). Since the deal is for 125 shares, my overall profit will be Rs.9387.5/- (Rs.75.1/- * 125).</p>\n<p>The seller obviously incurs a loss, as he is forced to sell TCS shares at Rs.2374.9 per share instead of selling it in the open market at a much higher price of Rs.2450/- per share. Clearly, the buyer’s gain is the seller loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – TCS stock price goes down by 24<sup>th</sup> Dec.</strong></p>\n<p>This is a case where my directional view on TCS shares has gone wrong. Therefore I would stand to lose.</p>\n<p>Assume on 24<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, the stock price of TCS goes down from Rs.2374.9/- to Rs.2300/- per share; by this decrease, the futures price will also be around the same level. This means, as per the agreement, I am obligated to buy the TCS shares at Rs.2374.9/- per share, which is a much higher price compared to what is available in the market. My loss will be Rs.75./- per share (Rs.2374.9 – Rs.2300). Since the deal is for 125 shares, my overall loss will be Rs.9375/- (Rs.75/- * 125).</p>\n<p>I would obviously incur a loss as I’m forced to buy the TCS shares at Rs.2374.9/- per share instead of buying it in the open market at a much lower price of Rs.2300/- per share. Clearly, the sellers gain is the buyer’s loss.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – TCS stock price remains unchanged.</strong></p>\n<p>Under such a situation, neither the buyer nor the seller benefit, hence there is no financial impact on either party.</p>\n<h2>3.3 – Exploiting a trading opportunity</h2>\n<p>So here is a situation – after buying the TCS futures on 15<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014 at Rs.2374.9/- the next day, i.e. 16<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, TCS price shot up. It is now trading at Rs.2460/-. What do I do? Clearly, with the price increase, I stand to benefit significantly. To be precise, at the time of taking the snapshot, I am sitting at a profit of Rs.85.1/- per share or Rs.10,637.5/- (Rs.85.1/- * 125) as an overall profit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image5_TCS.png\"><img alt=\"Image5_TCS\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1457\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"503\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image5_TCS.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image5_TCS.png 569w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image5_TCS-300x265.png 300w\" width=\"569\"/></a></p>\n<p>Suppose I am happy with the money that I have made overnight. Can I close out the agreement? Or rather, at Rs.2460 per share, what if my view changes? What if I no longer feel bullish about TCS at Rs.2460? Do I really need to hold on to the agreement until the contract expiry date, i.e. 24<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, by which time if the price goes down, it could lead to a loss?</p>\n<p>Well, as I had mentioned in the previous chapter, the futures agreement is tradable. Meaning, at any point after entering into a futures agreement, I can easily get out of the agreement by transferring the agreement to someone else. This means I can close the existing TCS futures position and book a profit of Rs.10,637.5/-. Not bad for a 1-day job, right? J</p>\n<p>Closing an existing futures position is called “square off”. By squaring off, I offset an existing open position.  In the case of the TCS example, I initially bought 1 lot of TCS futures, and when I square off, I have to sell 1 lot of TCS futures (so that my initial buy position is offset). The following table summarizes the concept of square off in general –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Serial No</th>\n<th>Initial Leg</th>\n<th>View at the time of initial leg</th>\n<th>Square off leg</th>\n<th>View at the time of squaring off</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>Buy / Long</td>\n<td>Expect the price to go higher – Bullish</td>\n<td>Sell</td>\n<td>No longer expect the price to go higher, or one wants to get out of the existing position (for whatever reason)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>Sell/Short</td>\n<td>Expect the price to go lower – Bearish</td>\n<td>Buy</td>\n<td>No longer expect the price to go lower, or one wants to get out of the existing position (for whatever reason)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>When I intend to square off a position, I can either call my broker asking him to square off the open position or do it myself on the trading terminal. In the example, we have a buy open position in TCS futures (1 lot). To offset this open position, the square off position would be to “sell 1 lot of TCS futures”. The following things happen when I opt to square off the TCS position –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The broker (via trading terminal) scouts for a counterparty that would be willing to buy the futures position from me. In simpler words, “my existing buy position will simply be transferred to someone else”. That ‘someone else’ by buying the contract from me now bears the TCS price’s risk going up or down. Hence this is referred to as the “Risk Transfer.”</li>\n<li>Note, the transfer will happen at the current futures price in the market, i.e. 2460/- per share.</li>\n<li>My position is considered to offset (or squared off) after the trade is executed.</li>\n<li>Once the trade is executed, the margins that were initially blocked would now be unblocked. I can utilize this cash for other transactions.</li>\n<li>The profit or loss made on the transaction will be credited or debited to my trading account the same evening itself.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And with this, the futures trade is now set to be complete.</p>\n<p>Note, if at Rs.2460 I develop a view that the price will be much higher; I could continue to hold the stock futures. In fact, I can continue to hold the futures till the contract’s expiry, i.e. 24<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014. As long as I continue to hold the futures, I continue to hold the risk of TCS price fluctuation. In fact, here is the snapshot of TCS futures taken on 23<sup>rd</sup> Dec 2014, just 1 day before the expiry of the contract. Had I opted to hold the futures till 23<sup>rd</sup> Dec, my profits would have been much higher – TCS futures is trading at Rs.2519.25/- per share.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image6_TCS.png\"><img alt=\"Image6_TCS\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1458\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"500\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image6_TCS.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image6_TCS.png 571w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Image6_TCS-300x263.png 300w\" width=\"571\"/></a></p>\n<p>In fact, on 16<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, when I decided to book profits at Rs.2460/-, ‘someone else’ bought the TCS futures from me. In other words, I transferred my buy position to someone else, and even that ‘someone else’ (the counterparty) would also have made money on this contract by buying the contract at Rs.2460/- from me and holding it until 23<sup>rd</sup> Dec 2014. Now here are two simple questions for you –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What would be my Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L) on a per share and an overall basis had I held the TCS futures from 15<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014 (Rs.2374.9) to 23<sup>rd</sup> Dec 2015 (Rs.2519.25)</li>\n<li>On 16<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, I squared off my position at Rs.2460/-, obviously by the contract’s square was transferred to a counterparty. Assuming the counterparty held on to the TCS futures position until 23<sup>rd</sup> Dec 2014, what would be his Profit &amp; Loss (P&amp;L) on a per-share basis and overall?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you cannot answer the above two questions, you can drop in a query in the comment box below, and I will be happy to explain the answer. But I sincerely hope you get the answers to the questions above yourself 🙂</p>\n<p>In the next chapter, we will discuss margins, an essential aspect of futures trading.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have a directional view on an assets price, you can financially benefit from it by entering into a futures agreement.</li>\n<li>To transact in a futures contract, one needs to deposit a token advance called the margin.</li>\n<li>When we transact in a futures contract, we digitally sign the agreement with the counterparty; this obligates us to honour the contract.</li>\n<li>The futures price and the spot price of an asset are different; this is attributable to the futures pricing formula (we will discuss this topic later)</li>\n<li>One lot refers to the minimum number of shares that needs to be transacted.</li>\n<li>Once we enter into a futures agreement, there is no obligation to stick to the agreement until the contract expires.</li>\n<li>Every futures trade requires a margin amount; the margins are blocked when you enter a futures trade.</li>\n<li>We can exit the agreement anytime, which means you can exit the agreement within seconds of entering the agreement.</li>\n<li>When we square off an agreement, we are essentially transferring the risk to someone else.</li>\n<li>Once we square off the futures position, margins are unblocked.</li>\n<li>The money that you make or lose in a futures transaction is credited or debited to your trading account the same day.</li>\n<li>In a futures contract, the buyer’s gain is the seller’s loss and vice versa.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

The futures trade example required us to go long on TCS futures as the expectation was that the TCS stock price would increase in due course. Further, we decided to square off the contract the very next day for a profit. However, if you recall, right at the beginning of the example, we posed a fundamental question; let me rephrase and repost the same for your ready reference.</p>\n<p>A rational to go long on TCS was built – the thought was that TCS stock price had overreacted to the management’s statement. I expected the stock price to increase in due course of time. A directional view was established, and hence a futures trade was initiated. The question was – anyway, the expectation is that the stock price will go higher, why should one bother about buying futures and why not the stock in the spot market?</p>\n<p>In fact, buying futures requires one to enter a digital agreement with the counterparty. Besides, a futures agreement is time-bound, meaning the directional view has to pan out within the specified time period. If it does not pan out within the specified time (as in the expiry), one has to suffer a loss. Contrast this (futures buying) with just buying stock and letting it reside in your DEMAT account. There is no obligation of an agreement or the pressure of time. So why does one really need futures? What makes it so attractive? Why not just buy the stock and stay oblivious to the stock price and the time?</p>\n<p>The answers to all these questions lie in the financial leverage inherent in financial derivatives, including futures. As they say, Leverage is a true financial innovation; if used in the right context and spirit, leverage can create wealth. Without much ado, let us explore this angle of futures trading.</p>\n<h2>4.2 – Leverage in perspective</h2>\n<p>Leverage is something we use at some point or the other in our lives. We don’t think about it in the way it is supposed to be thought about. We miss seeing through the numbers and therefore never really appreciate the essence of leverage.</p>\n<p>Here is a classic example of leverage – many of you may relate to this one.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine is a real estate trader; he likes to buy apartments, sites, and buildings, hold them for a while, and then sell them for a later stage. He believes this is better than trading inequities, and I beg to differ – I could go on and on debating this, but maybe some other time.</p>\n<p>Anyway, here is a summary of a recent real estate transaction he carried out. In November 2013, Prestige Builders (popular builders in Bangalore) identified land in South Bangalore. They announced a new project – A luxurious apartment complex with state of the art amenities. My friend jumped in and booked a 2 bedroom, hall, and kitchen apartment, expected to come up on the 9<sup>th</sup> floor for a sum of Rs.10,000,000/-. The project is expected to be completed by mid-2018. Since the apartment was just notified, and no work had started, the potential buyers were only required to pay 10% of the actual buy value. This is pretty much the norm when it comes to buying brand new apartments. The remaining 90% was scheduled to be paid as the construction progressed.</p>\n<p>So back in Nov 2013, for an initial cash outlay of Rs.10,00,000/- (10% of 10,000,000/-), my friend was entitled to buy a property worth Rs.10,000,000/-. In fact, the property was so hot; all the 120 apartments were sold out like hot cakes just within 2 months of Prestige Builder announcing the brand new project.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to Dec 2014, and my friend had a potential buyer for his apartment. Being a real estate trader, my friend jumped into the opportunity. A quick survey revealed that the area’s property value had appreciated by at least 25% (well, that’s how crazy real estate is in Bangalore). So my friend’s 9th-floor apartment was now valued at Rs.12,500,000/-. My friend and the potential buyer struck a deal and settled on the sale at Rs.12,500,000/-.</p>\n<p>Here is a table summarizing the transaction –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Particulars</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Initial Value of Apartment</td>\n<td>Rs. 10,000,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Date of Purchase</td>\n<td>November 2013</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Initial Cash outlay @ 10% of the apartment value</td>\n<td>Rs.10,00,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Balance Payment to Builder</td>\n<td>Rs.90,00,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Appreciation in apartment value</td>\n<td>25%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Value of the apartment in Dec 2014</td>\n<td>Rs.12,500,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>New buyer agrees to pay the balance payment</td>\n<td>Rs.90,00,000/- to the builder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>My friend gets paid</td>\n<td>12,500,000 – 9000000 = <strong>Rs.35,00,000/-</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>My friend’s profit on the transaction</td>\n<td>Rs.35,00,000/- minus Rs.10,00,000/- = <strong>Rs.25,00,000/-</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Return on investment</td>\n<td>25,00,000 / 10,00,000 = <strong>250%</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Clearly, few things stand out in this transaction.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>My friend was able to participate in a <strong>large transaction</strong> by paying only 10% of the transaction value.</li>\n<li>To enter into the transaction, my friend had to pay 10% of the actual value (call it the contract value)</li>\n<li>The initial value he pays (10 lakhs) can be considered a token advance, or in terms of ‘Futures Agreement,’ it would be the initial margin deposit.</li>\n<li>A small change in the asset value impacts the return massively.</li>\n<li>This is quite obvious – a 25% increase in asset value resulted in a 250% return on investment.</li>\n<li>A transaction of this type is called a “<strong>Leveraged Transaction.</strong>”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do make sure you understand this example thoroughly because this is very similar to a futures trade, as all futures transactions are leveraged. Do keep this example in perspective as we will now move back to the TCS trade.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M4-Ch4-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1444\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch4-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch4-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch4-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>4.3 – The Leverage</h2>\n<p>While we looked at the futures trade’s overall structure in the previous chapter, let us now re-work the TCS example with some specific details. For the sake of simplicity, the trade details are as follows: we will assume the opportunity to buy TCS occurs on the 15<sup>th</sup> of Dec at Rs.2362/- per share. Further, we will assume the opportunity to square off this position occurs on 23<sup>rd</sup> Dec 2014 at Rs.2519/-. Also, we will assume there is no difference between the spot and futures price.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Particulars</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Underlying</td>\n<td>TCS Limited</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Directional View</td>\n<td>Bullish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Action</td>\n<td>Buy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Capital available for the trade</td>\n<td>Rs.100,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trade Type</td>\n<td>Short term</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Remarks</td>\n<td>The expectation is that the stock price will increase over the next few days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>By Date</td>\n<td>15th Dec 2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Approximate buy Price</td>\n<td>Rs.2362/- per share</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sell Date</td>\n<td>23rd Dec 2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Approximate Sell Price</td>\n<td>Rs.2519/- per share</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So with a bullish view on TCS stock price and Rs.100,000/ in hand, we have to decide between the two options at our disposal – <strong>Option 1</strong> – Buy TCS stock in the spot market or <strong>Option 2</strong> – Buy TCS futures from the Derivatives market. Let us evaluate each option to understand the respective dynamics.</p>\n<p><strong>Option 1</strong> – Buy TCS Stock in the spot market</p>\n<p>Buying TCS in the spot market requires us to check for the price at which the stock is trading and calculate the number of stocks we can afford to buy (with the capital at our disposal). After buying the stock in the spot market, we have to wait for at least two working days (T+2) to get credited to our DEMAT account. Once the stocks reside in the DEMAT account, we just have to wait for the right opportunity to sell them.</p>\n<p>Few salient features of buying the stock in the spot market (delivery based buying) –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Once we buy the stock (for delivery to DEMAT), we have to wait for at least 2 working days before deciding to sell it. This means even if the very next day, if a good opportunity to sell comes up, we cannot really sell the stock.</li>\n<li>We can buy the stock to the extent of the capital at our disposal. Meaning if our disposable cash is Rs.100,000/- we can only buy to the extent of Rs.100,000/- not beyond this.</li>\n<li>There is no pressure of time – as long as one has the time and patience, one can wait for a really long time before deciding to sell</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Specifically, with Rs.100,000/- at our disposal, on 15<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, we can buy –</p>\n<p>= 100,000 / 2362</p>\n<p>~ 42 shares</p>\n<p>Now, on 23<sup>rd</sup> Dec 2014, when TCS is trading at Rs.2519/- we can square off the position for a profit –</p>\n<p>= 42 * 2519</p>\n<p>= Rs.105,798/-</p>\n<p>So Rs.100,000/- invested in TCS on 14<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014 has now turned into Rs.105,798/- on 23<sup>rd</sup> Dec 2014, generating Rs.5,798/- in profits. Interesting, let us check the return generated by this trade –</p>\n<p>= [5798/100,000] * 100</p>\n<p>= 5.79 %</p>\n<p>A 5.79% return over 9 days is quite impressive. In fact, a 9-day return of 5.79% when annualized yields about 235%. This is phenomenal!</p>\n<p>But how does this contrast with option 2?</p>\n<p><strong>Option 2</strong> – Buy TCS Stock in the futures market</p>\n<p>Recall in futures market variables are predetermined. For instance, the minimum number of shares (lot size) that needs to be bought in TCS is 125 or in multiples of 125. The lot size multiplied by the futures price gives us the ‘contract value’. We know the futures price is Rs.2362/- per share; hence the contract value is –</p>\n<p>= 125 * 2362</p>\n<p>= Rs.295,250/-</p>\n<p>Does that mean to participate in the futures market, I need Rs.295,250/- in total cash? Not really; Rs. 295,250/- is the contract value; however, to participate in the futures market, one just needs to deposit a margin amount which is a certain % of the contract value. In the case of TCS futures, we need about 14% margin. At 14% margin (14% of Rs.295,250/-), Rs.41,335/- is all we need to enter into a futures agreement. At this stage, you may get the following questions in your mind –</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>What about the balance money? i.e Rs.253,915/- ( Rs.295,250/ minus Rs.41,335/-)\n<ul>\n<li>Well, that money is never really paid out.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What do I mean by ‘never really paid out’?\n<ul>\n<li>We will understand this in greater clarity when we take up the chapter on “Settlement – mark 2 markets.”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Is 14% fixed for all stocks?\n<ul>\n<li>No, it varies from stock to stock.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, keeping these few points in perspective, let us explore the futures trade further. The cash available in hand is Rs.100,000/-. However, the cash requirement in terms of margin amount is just Rs. Rs.41,335/-.</p>\n<p>This means instead of 1 lot, maybe we can buy 2 lots of TCS futures. With 2 lots of TCS futures, the number of shares would be 250 (125 * 2) – at the cost of Rs.82,670/- as the margin requirement. After committing Rs.82,670/- as margin amount for 2 lots, we would still be left with Rs.17,330/- in cash. But we cannot really do anything with this money; hence it is best left untouched.</p>\n<p>Now here is how the TCS futures equation stacks up –</p>\n<p>Lot Size – 125</p>\n<p>No of lots – 2</p>\n<p>Futures Buy price – Rs. 2362/-</p>\n<p>Futures Contract Value at the time of buying = Lot size *number of lots* Futures Buy Price</p>\n<p>= 125 * 2 * Rs. 2362/-</p>\n<p>= Rs. 590,500/-</p>\n<p>Margin Amount – Rs.82,670/-</p>\n<p>Futures Sell price = Rs.2519/-</p>\n<p>Futures Contract Value at the time of selling = 125 * 2 * 2519</p>\n<p>= Rs.629,750/-</p>\n<p>This translates to a profit of Rs. 39,250/-!</p>\n<p>Can you see the difference? A move from 2361 to 2519 generated a profit of Rs.5,798/- in the spot market, but the same move generated Rs’ profit. 39,250/-. Let us see how juicy this looks in terms of % return.</p>\n<p>Remember our investment for the futures trade is Rs.82,670/-, hence the return has to be calculated keeping this as the base –</p>\n<p>[39,250 / 82,670]*100</p>\n<p>Well, this translates to a whopping 47% over 9 days! Contrast that with 5.79% in the spot market. For the sake of annualizing, this translates to an annual return of 1925 % …. With this, hopefully, I should have convinced you why short term traders prefer transactions in the Futures market as opposed to spot market transactions.</p>\n<p>Futures offer something more than a plain vanilla spot market transaction. Thanks to the existence of ‘Margins’, you require a much lesser amount to enter into a relatively large transaction. If your directional view is right, your profits can be huge.</p>\n<p>We can take positions much bigger than the capital available; this is called “Leverage”. Leverage is a double-edged sword. If used in the right spirit and knowledge, leverage can create wealth; if not, it can destroy wealth.</p>\n<p>Before we proceed further, let us just summarize the contrast between the spot and futures market in the following table –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Particular</th>\n<th>Spot Market</th>\n<th>Futures Markets</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Capital Available</td>\n<td>Rs.100,000/-</td>\n<td>Rs.100,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>By Date</td>\n<td>15th Dec 2014</td>\n<td>15th Dec 2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Buy Price</td>\n<td>Rs.2362 per share</td>\n<td>Rs.2362 per share</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Qty</td>\n<td>100,000 / 2362 = 42 shares</td>\n<td>Depends on Lot size</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lot Size</td>\n<td>Not Applicable</td>\n<td>125</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Margin</td>\n<td>Not Applicable</td>\n<td>14%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contract value per lot</td>\n<td>Not Applicable</td>\n<td>125 * 2362 = 295,250/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Margin Deposit per lot</td>\n<td>Not Applicable</td>\n<td>14% * 295,250 = 41,335/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How many lots can be bought</td>\n<td>Not Applicable</td>\n<td>100,000/41,335= 2.4 or 2 Lots</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Margin Deposit</td>\n<td>Not Applicable</td>\n<td>41,335 * 2 = 82,670/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>No of shares bought</td>\n<td>42 (as calculated above)</td>\n<td>125 * 2 = 250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Buy Value (Contract Value)</td>\n<td>42 * 2362 = 100,000/-</td>\n<td>2 * 125 * 2362 = 590,500/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sell Date</td>\n<td>23rd Dec 2014</td>\n<td>23rd Dec 2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>No of days trade was live</td>\n<td>9 days</td>\n<td>9 days</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sell Price</td>\n<td>Rs.2519/- per share</td>\n<td>Rs.2519/- per share</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sell Value</td>\n<td>42 * 2519 = 105,798</td>\n<td>250 * 2519 = 629,750/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Profit earned</td>\n<td>105798 – 100000 = Rs.5798/-</td>\n<td>629750 – 590500 = Rs.39,250/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Absolute Return for 9 days</td>\n<td>5798 / 100,000 = 5.79 %</td>\n<td>39250 / 82670 = 47%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>% Return annualized</td>\n<td>235%</td>\n<td>1925%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>All through, we have discussed rewards of transacting in futures, but what about the risk involved? What if the directional view does not pan out as expected? To understand both the sides of a futures trade, we need to understand how much money we stand to make (or lose) based on the underlying movement. This is called the “Futures Payoff”.</p>\n<h2>4.4 – Leverage Calculation</h2>\n<p>Usually, when we talk about leverage, the common questions one gets asked is – “How many times leverage are you exposed to?” The higher the leverage, the higher is the risk, and the higher is the profit potential.</p>\n<p>Calculating leverage is quite easy –</p>\n<p><b>Leverage = [Contract Value/Margin]</b>. Hence for TCS trade the leverage is</p>\n<p>= [295,250/41,335]</p>\n<p>= 7.14, which is read as 7.14 times or simply as a ratio – 1: 7.14.</p>\n<p>This means every Rs.1/- in the trading account can buy upto Rs.7.14/- worth of TCS. This is a very manageable ratio. However, if the leverage increases, then the risk also increases. Allow me to explain.</p>\n<p>At 7.14 times leverage, TCS has to fall by 14% for one to lose all the margin amount; this can be calculated as –</p>\n<p><b>1 / Leverage</b></p>\n<p>= 1/ 7.14</p>\n<p>= 14%</p>\n<p>Now for a moment, assume the margin requirement was just Rs.7000/- instead of Rs.41,335/-. In this case, the leverage would be –</p>\n<p>= 295,250 / 7000</p>\n<p>= 42.17 times</p>\n<p>This is clearly is a very high leverage ratio. One will lose all his capital if TCS falls by –</p>\n<p>1/41.17</p>\n<p>= 2.3%.</p>\n<p>So, the higher the leverage, the higher is the risk. When leverage is high, only a small move in the underlying is required to wipe out the margin deposit.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, at roughly 42 times leverage, you just need a 2.3% move in the underlying to double your money.☺</p>\n<p>I personally don’t like to over-leverage. I stick to trades where the leverage is about 1:10 or about 1:12, not beyond this.</p>\n<h2>4.5 – The Futures payoff</h2>\n<p>Imagine this – when I bought TCS futures, the expectation was that TCS stock price would go higher, and therefore, I would financially benefit from the futures transaction. But what if instead of going up, TCS stock price went down? I would obviously make a loss. Think about it after initiating a futures trade. At every price point, I would either stand to make a profit or loss. The payoff structure of a futures transaction simply highlights the extent to which I either make a profit or loss at various possible price points.</p>\n<p>To understand the payoff structure better, let us build one for the TCS trade. Remember it is a long trade initiated at Rs.2362/- on 16<sup>th</sup> of Dec. After initiating the trade, by 23<sup>rd</sup> Dec, the price of TCS can go anywhere. Like I mentioned, at every price point, I will either make a profit or a loss. Hence while building the structure’s pay, I will assume various possible price point situations that can pan out by 23<sup>rd</sup> Dec, and I will analyze the P&amp;L situation at each of these possibilities. In fact, the table below does the same –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Possible Price on 23rd Dec</th>\n<th>Buyer P&amp;L (Price on 23rd Dec – Buy Price)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2160</td>\n<td style=\"color: red;\">(202)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2180</td>\n<td style=\"color: red;\">(182)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2200</td>\n<td style=\"color: red;\">(162)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2220</td>\n<td style=\"color: red;\">(142)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2240</td>\n<td style=\"color: red;\">(122)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2260</td>\n<td style=\"color: red;\">(102)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2280</td>\n<td style=\"color: red;\">(82)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2300</td>\n<td style=\"color: red;\">(62)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2320</td>\n<td style=\"color: red;\">(42)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2340</td>\n<td style=\"color: red;\">(22)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2360</td>\n<td style=\"color: red;\">(2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2380</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2400</td>\n<td>38</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2420</td>\n<td>58</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2440</td>\n<td>78</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2460</td>\n<td>98</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2480</td>\n<td>118</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2500</td>\n<td>138</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2520</td>\n<td>158</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2540</td>\n<td>178</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2560</td>\n<td>198</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2580</td>\n<td>218</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2600</td>\n<td>238</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>This is the way you need to read this table – considering you are a buyer at Rs.2362/-, what would be the P&amp;L by 23<sup>rd</sup> Dec assuming TCS is trading is Rs.2160/-. As the table suggests, you would make a loss of Rs.202/-per share (2362 – 2160).</p>\n<p>Likewise, what would be your P&amp;L if TCS is trading at 2600? Well, as the table suggest, you would make a profit of Rs.238/- per share (2600 – 2362). So on and so forth.</p>\n<p>In fact, if you recollect from the previous chapter, we stated that if the buyer is making Rs. X/- as profit, then the seller is suffering a loss to the extent of Rs. X/-. So assuming  23<sup>rd</sup> Dec TCS is Trading at 2600, the buyer makes a profit of Rs.238/- per share, and the seller would be making a loss of Rs.238/- per share, provided that the seller has shorted the share at Rs.2362/-.</p>\n<p>Another way to look at this is that the money is being transferred from the seller’s pocket to the buyer’s pocket. It is just a transfer of money and not a creation of money!</p>\n<p>There is a difference between the transfer of money and creation of money. Money is generated when the value is created. For example, you have bought TCS shares from a long term perspective, TCS as a business does well, profits and margins improve. Obviously, you as a shareholder will benefit from under-appreciation in the share price. This is money creation or wealth generation. If you contrast this with Futures, money is not being created but moving from one pocket to another.</p>\n<p>Precisely for this reasons, Futures (rather financial derivatives in general) is called a “<strong>Zero Sum Game</strong>”.</p>\n<p>Further, let us now plot a graph of the possible price on 23<sup>rd</sup> December versus the buyers P&amp;L. This is also called the <strong>“Payoff Structure”.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch4-Chart11.png\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch4-Chart1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1442\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"278\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch4-Chart11.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch4-Chart11.png 500w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch4-Chart11-300x167.png 300w\" width=\"500\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, any price above the buy price (2362) results in a profit and any price below the buy price results in a loss. Since the trade involved purchasing 2 lots of futures (250 shares), a 1 point positive movement (from 2362 to 2363) results in a gain of Rs.250. Likewise, a 1 point negative movement (from 2362 to 2361) results in a loss of Rs.250. Clearly, there is a sense of proportionality here. The proportionality comes from the fact that the money made by the buyer is the loss suffered by the seller (provided they have bought/short the same price), and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, because the P&amp;L is a smooth straight line, it is said that the futures are a “<strong>Linear Payoff Instrument</strong>”.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Leverage plays a key role in futures trading.</li>\n<li>Margins allow us to deposit a small amount of money and take exposure to a large value transaction.</li>\n<li>Margins charged is usually a % of the contract value.</li>\n<li>Spot market transactions are not leveraged; we can transact to the extent of our capital.</li>\n<li>Under leverage, a small change in the underlying results in a massive impact on the P&amp;L</li>\n<li>The profits made by the buyer is equivalent to the loss made by the seller and vice versa.</li>\n<li>The higher the leverage, the higher is the risk and, therefore, the higher the chance of making money.</li>\n<li>Futures Instrument simply allows one to transfer money from one pocket to another.

In fact, margins are the one that gives a ‘Futures Agreement’ the required financial twist (as compared to the spot market transaction). For this reason, understanding the margins and many facets of margins is extremely important.</p>\n<p>However, before we proceed any further, let us list down a list of things you should know by now. These are concepts we had learnt over the last 4 chapters; reiterating these crucial takeaways will help us consolidate all the learning. If you are not clear about any of the following points, you will need to revisit the previous chapters and refresh your understanding.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Future is an improvisation over the Forwards.</li>\n<li>The futures agreement inherits the transactional structure of the forwards market.</li>\n<li>A futures agreement enables you to financially benefit if you have an accurate directional view of the asset price.</li>\n<li>The futures agreement derives its value from its corresponding underlying in the spot market.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>For example, TCS Futures derives its value from the underlying in the TCS Spot market.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The Futures price mimics the underlying price in the spot market.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The futures price and the spot price of an asset are different, attributable to the futures pricing formula. We will discuss this point at a later stage in the module.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The futures contract is a standardized contract wherein the agreement variables are predetermined – lot size and expiry date.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The lot size is the minimum quantity specified in the futures contract.</li>\n<li>Contract value = Futures Price * Lot Size</li>\n<li>Expiry is the last date up to which one can hold the futures agreement.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>To enter into a futures agreement, one has to deposit a margin amount calculated as a certain % of the contract value.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Margins allow us to deposit a small amount of money and take exposure to a large value transaction, thereby leveraging the transaction.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>When we transact in a futures contract, we digitally sign the agreement with the counterparty; this obligates us to honour the contract upon expiry.</li>\n<li>The futures agreement is tradable. Which means you need not hold on to the agreement till the expiry\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>You can hold the futures contract until you have a conviction on the asset’s directional view; once your view changes, you can get out of the futures agreement.</li>\n<li>You can even hold the futures agreement for a few minutes and financially benefit if the price moves in your .favour</li>\n<li>An example of the above point would be to buy Infosys Futures at 9:15 AM for 1951 and sell it by 9:17 AM in 1953. Since Infosys lot size is 250, one would stand to make Rs.500/- (2 * 250) within a matter of 2 minutes</li>\n<li>You can even choose to hold it overnight for a few days or hold on to it till expiry.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Equity futures contracts are cash-settled</li>\n<li>Under leverage, a small change in the underlying results in a massive impact on the P&amp;L</li>\n<li>The profits made by the buyer is equivalent to the loss made by the seller and vice versa.</li>\n<li>Futures Instrument allows one to transfer money from one pocket to another. Hence it is called a “Zero Sum Game.”</li>\n<li>The higher the leverage, the higher the risk.</li>\n<li>The payoff structure of a futures instrument is linear.</li>\n<li>The futures market is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Thanks to the watchful eye of SEBI, there has been no incidence of counterparty default in the futures market.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you can clearly understand the points mentioned above, then I’d assume you are on the right track so far. If you have any questions on any of the above-mentioned points, you need to revisit the previous four chapters to get the concept right.</p>\n<p>Anyway, assuming you are clear so far, let us now focus more on the concept of margins and mark to market.</p>\n<h2>5.2 – Why are Margins charged?</h2>\n<p>Let us now rewind to the example we quoted in the forwards market (chapter 1). In the example quoted, 3 months from now, ABC Jewelers agrees to buy 15Kgs of Gold at Rs.2450/- per gram from XYZ Gold Dealers.</p>\n<p>We can now clearly appreciate that any gold price variation will either affect ABC or XYZ negatively. If the price of gold increases, then XYZ suffers a loss, and ABC makes a profit. Likewise, if the price of gold decreases, ABC suffers a loss, and XYZ makes a profit. Also, we know that a forwards agreement works on a gentleman’s word. Consider a situation where gold price has drastically increased, placing XYZ Gold Dealers in a difficult spot. Clearly, XYZ can say they cannot make the necessary payment and thereby default on the deal. Obviously, what follows will be a long and gruelling legal chase, but outside our focus area. The point to be noted here is that in a forwards agreement, the scope and the incentive to default is very high.</p>\n<p>Since the futures market is an improvisation over the forwards market, the default angle is carefully and intelligently dealt with. This is where the margins play a role.</p>\n<p>In the forwards market, there is no regulator. The agreement takes place between two parties with literally no intermediary watching over their transaction. However, in the futures market, all trades are routed through an exchange. The exchange in return takes the onus of guaranteeing the settlement of all the trades. When I say ‘onus of guaranteeing’, it literally means the exchange makes sure you get your money if you are entitled. This also means they ensure they collect the money from the party who is supposed to pay up.</p>\n<p>So how does the exchange make sure this works seamlessly? Well, they make this happen using –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Collecting the margins</li>\n<li>Marking the daily profits or losses to market (also called M2M)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We briefly looked into the concept of Margin in the previous chapter. The concept of Margin and M2M is something that you need to know in parallel to appreciate futures trading dynamics fully. However, since it is difficult to explain both the concepts simultaneously, I would like to pause a bit on margins and proceed to M2M. We will understand M2M completely and come back again to margins. We will then relook at margins keeping M2M in perspective. But before we move to M2M, I would like you to keep the following points in the back of your mind –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At the time of initiating the futures position, margins are blocked in your trading account.</li>\n<li>The margins that get blocked is also called the “Initial Margin.”</li>\n<li>The initial margin is made up of two components, i.e. SPAN margin and the Exposure Margin.</li>\n<li><b>Initial Margin = SPAN Margin + Exposure Margin</b></li>\n<li>Initial Margin will be blocked in your trading account for how many days you choose to hold the futures trade.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The value of the initial margin varies daily as it depends on the futures price.</li>\n<li>Remember, Initial Margin = % of Contract Value</li>\n<li>Contract Value = Futures Price * Lot Size</li>\n<li>The lot size is fixed, but the futures price varies every day. This means the margins also vary every day.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, for now, remember just these points. We will go ahead to understand M2M, and then we will come back to margins to complete this chapter.</p>\n<h2>5.3 – Mark to Market (M2M)</h2>\n<p>As we know, the futures price fluctuates daily, under which you either stand to make a profit or a loss. Marking to market or mark to market (M2M) is a simple accounting procedure which involves adjusting the profit or loss you have made for the day and entitling you the same. As long as you hold the futures contract, M2M is applicable. Let us take up a simple example to understand this.</p>\n<p>Assume on 1<sup>st</sup> Dec 2014 at around 11:30 AM; you decide to buy Hindalco Futures at Rs.165/-. The Lot size is 2000. 4 days later, on 4<sup>th</sup> Dec 2014, you decide to square off the position at 2:15 PM at Rs.170.10/-. Clearly, as the calculation below shows, this is a profitable trade –</p>\n<p>Buy Price = Rs.165</p>\n<p>Sell Price = Rs.170.1</p>\n<p>Profit per share = (170.1 – 165) = Rs.5.1/-</p>\n<p>Total Profit = 2000 * 5.1</p>\n<p><b>= Rs.10,200/-</b></p>\n<p>However, the trade was held for 4 working days. Each day the futures contract is held, the profits or loss is marked to market. While marking to market, the previous day closing price is taken as the reference rate to calculate the profit or losses.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Day</th>\n<th>Closing Price</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st Dec 2014</td>\n<td>168.3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd Dec 2014</td>\n<td>172.4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd Dec 2014</td>\n<td>171.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th Dec 2014</td>\n<td>169.9</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The table above shows the futures price movement over the 4 days the contract was held. Let us look at what happens on a day to day basis to understand how M2M works –</p>\n<p>On <b>Day 1</b> at 11:30 AM, the futures contract was purchased at Rs.165/-, clearly after the contract was purchased, the price has gone up further to close at Rs.168.3/-. Hence profit for the day is 168.3 minus 165 = Rs.3.3/- per share. Since the lot size is 2000, the net profit for the day is 3.3*2000 = Rs.6600/-.</p>\n<p>Hence the exchange ensures (via the broker) that Rs.6600/- is credited to your trading account at the end of the day.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>But where is this money coming from?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Obviously, it is coming from the counterparty. Which means the exchange is also ensuring that the counterparty is paying up Rs.6600/- towards his loss</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>But how does the exchange ensure they get this money from the party who is supposed to pay up?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Obviously, through the margins that are deposited at the time of initiating the trade. But more on this later.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now here is another important aspect you need to note – from an accounting perspective, the futures buy price is no longer treated as Rs.165 but instead, it will be considered as Rs.168.3/- (closing price of the day). Why is that so, you may ask? The profit earned for the day has been given to you already using crediting the trading account. So you are fair and square for the day, and the next day is considered a fresh start. Hence the buy price is now considered at Rs. 168.3, which is the closing price of the day.</p>\n<p>On <b>day 2</b>, the futures closed at Rs.172.4/-, clearly another day of profit. The day’s profit would be Rs.172.4/ – minus Rs.168.3/- i.e. Rs.4.1/- per share or Rs.8,200/- net profit. The profits that you are entitled to receive is credited to your trading account, and the buy price is reset to the day’s closing price, i.e. 172.4/-.</p>\n<p>On <b>day 3</b>, the futures closed at Rs.171.6/- which means concerning the previous day’s close price, there is a loss to the extent of Rs.1600/- (172.4-171.6) * 2000. The loss amount will be automatically debited from your trading account. Also, the buy price is now reset to Rs.171.6/-.</p>\n<p>On <b>day 4</b>, the trader did not continue to hold the position through the day but rather decided to square off the position mid-day 2:15 PM at Rs.170.10/-. Hence concerning the previous day’s close, he again made a loss. That would be a loss of Rs.171.6/- minus Rs.170.1/- = Rs.1.5/- per share and Rs.3000/- (1.5 * 2000) net loss. Needless to say, after the square off, it does not matter where the futures price goes as the trader has squared off his position. Also, Rs.3000/- is debited from the trading account by the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Now, let us just tabulate the value of the daily mark to market and see how much money has come in and how much money has gone out –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Day</th>\n<th>Ref Price for M2M</th>\n<th>Closing Price</th>\n<th>Daily M2M</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st Dec 2014</td>\n<td>165</td>\n<td>168.3</td>\n<td>+ Rs.6,600/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd Dec 2014</td>\n<td>168.3</td>\n<td>172.4</td>\n<td>+Rs.8,200/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd Dec 2014</td>\n<td>172.4</td>\n<td>171.6</td>\n<td><span style=\"color: red;\">-Rs.1,600/-</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th Dec 2014</td>\n<td>171.6 &amp; 170.1</td>\n<td>169.9</td>\n<td><span style=\"color: red;\">– Rs.3,000/-</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td><strong>+Rs.10,200/-</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Well, if you summed up all the M2M cash flow, you will end up the same amount that we originally calculated, which is –</p>\n<p>Buy Price = Rs.165/-</p>\n<p>Sell Price = Rs.170.1/-</p>\n<p>Profit per share = (170.1 – 165) = Rs.5.1/-</p>\n<p>Total Profit = 2000 * 5.1</p>\n<p><b>= Rs.10,200/-</b></p>\n<p>So, the mark to market is just a daily accounting adjustment where –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Money is either credited or debited (also called daily obligation)  based on how the futures price behaves.</li>\n<li>The previous day close price is taken into consideration to calculate the present-day M2M.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why do you think M2M is required in the first place? Think about it – M2M is a daily cash adjustment by which the exchange drastically reduces the counterparty default risk. As long a trader holds the contract, the exchange by the M2M ensures both the parties are fair and square daily.</p>\n<p>Keeping this basic concept of M2M, let us now move back to relook at margins and see how the trade evolves during its life.</p>\n<h2>5.4 – Margins, the bigger perspective</h2>\n<p>Let us now relook at margins keeping M2M in perspective. As mentioned earlier, the margins required to initiate a futures trade are called “Initial Margin (IM)”. Initial margin is a certain % of the contract value. We also know –</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Initial Margin (IM) = SPAN Margin + Exposure Margin</b></p>\n<p>Every time a trader initiates a futures trade (for that matter, any trade), few financial intermediaries work in the background, ensuring that the trade carries out smoothly. The two prominent financial intermediaries are the broker and the exchange.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M4-Ch5-chart\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1476\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"31\" sizes=\"(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch5-chart1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch5-chart1.jpg 437w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch5-chart1-300x21.jpg 300w\" width=\"437\"/></p>\n<p>If the client defaults on an obligation, it obviously has a financial repercussion on both the broker and the exchange. Hence if both the financial intermediaries have to be insulated against a possible client default, they need to be covered adequately using a margin deposit.</p>\n<p>In fact, this is exactly how it works – ‘SPAN Margin’ is the minimum requisite margins blocked as per the exchange’s mandate, and ‘Exposure Margin’ is the margin blocked over and above the SPAN to cushion for any MTM losses. Do note both SPAN and Exposure margin are specified by the exchange. So at the time of initiating a futures trade, the client has to adhere to the initial margin requirement. The exchange blocks the entire initial margin (SPAN + Exposure).</p>\n<p>SPAN Margin is more important between the two margins as not having this in your account means a penalty from the exchange. The SPAN margin requirement must be strictly <b>maintained</b> as long as the trader wishes to carry his position overnight/next day. For this reason, SPAN margin is also sometimes referred to as the “<b>Maintenance Margin</b>”.</p>\n<p>So how does the exchange decide what should be the SPAN margin requirement for a particular futures contract? Well, they use an advance algorithm to calculate the SPAN margins daily. One of the key inputs that go into this algorithm is the ‘Volatility’ of the stock. Volatility is a very crucial concept; we will discuss it at length in the next module. For now, just remember this – if volatility is expected to go up, the SPAN margin requirement also goes up.</p>\n<p>Exposure margin, which is an additional margin, varies between 4% -5% of the contract value.</p>\n<p>Now, let us look at a futures trade, keeping both the margin and the M2M perspective. The trade details are as shown below –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Particular</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Symbol</td>\n<td>HDFC Bank Limited</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trade Type</td>\n<td>Long</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>By Date</td>\n<td>10th Dec 2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Buy Price</td>\n<td>Rs.938.7/- per share</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sell Date</td>\n<td>19th Dec</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sell Price</td>\n<td>Rs.955/- per share</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lot Size</td>\n<td>250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Contract Value</td>\n<td>250*938.7 = Rs.234,675/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SPAN Margin</td>\n<td>7.5% of CV = Rs.17,600/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Exp Margin</td>\n<td>5.0% of CV = Rs.11,733/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IM (SPAN + Exposure)</td>\n<td>17600 + 11733 = Rs.29,334/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>P&amp;L per share</td>\n<td>Profit of Rs.16.3/- per share (955 – 938.7)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net Profit</td>\n<td>250 * 16.3 = Rs.4,075/-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If you are trading with Zerodha, you may know that we provide a Margin calculator that explicitly states the SPAN and Exposure margin requirements. Of course, at a later stage, we will discuss the utility of this handy tool in detail. But for now, you could check out this <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/margin-calculator/SPAN/\">margin calculator</a>.</p>\n<p>Keeping the above trade details in perspective, let us look at how the margins and M2M plays a role simultaneously during the life of the trade. The table below shows how the dynamics change on a day to day basis –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch5_table.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch5_table\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1472\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"198\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch5_table.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch5_table.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch5_table-300x99.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>I hope you don’t get intimidated looking at the table above; in fact, it is quite easy to understand. Let us go through it sequentially, day by day.</p>\n<p><b>10</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b> Dec 2014</b></p>\n<p>Sometime during the day, HDFC Bank futures contract was purchased at Rs.938.7/-. The lot size is 250. Hence the contract value is Rs.234,675/-. As we can see from the box on the right, SPAN is 7.5%, and Exposure is 5% of CV, respectively. Hence 12.5% of CV is blocked as margins (SPAN + Exposure); this works up to a total margin of Rs.29,334/-. The initial margin is also considered as the <b>initial cash blocked </b>by the broker.</p>\n<p>Going ahead, HDFC closes at 940 for the day. At 940, the CV is now Rs.235,000/- and therefore, the total margin requirement is Rs.29,375/- which is a marginal increase of Rs.41/- compared to the margin required at the time of the trade initiation. The client is not required to infuse this money into his account as he is sufficiently covered with an M2M profit of Rs.325/- which will be credited to his account.</p>\n<p>The total cash balance in the trading account = Cash Balance + M2M</p>\n<p>= Rs.29,334 + Rs.325</p>\n<p><b>= Rs.29,659/-</b></p>\n<p>Clearly, the cash balance is more than the total margin requirement of Rs.29,375/- hence there is no problem. Further, the reference rate for the next day’s M2M is now set to Rs.940/-.</p>\n<p><b>11</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b> Dec 2014</b></p>\n<p>The next day, HDFC Bank drop by Rs.1/- to Rs.939/- per share, impacting the M2M by negative Rs.250/-. This money is taken out from the cash balance (and will be credited to the person making this money). Hence the new cash balance will be –</p>\n<p>= 29659 – 250</p>\n<p>= Rs.29,409/-</p>\n<p>Also, the new margin requirement is calculated as Rs.29,344/-. Clearly, the cash balance is higher than the margin required; hence there is nothing to worry about. Also, the reference rate for the next day’s M2M is reset at Rs.939/-</p>\n<p><b>12</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b> Dec 2014</b></p>\n<p>This is an interesting day. The futures price fell by Rs.9/- taking the price to Rs.930/- per share. At Rs.930/- the margin requirement also falls to Rs.29,063/-. However, because of an M2M loss of Rs.2250/- the cash balance drops to Rs.27,159/- (29409 – 2250), which is less than the total margin requirement. Since the cash balance is less than the total margin requirement, is the client required to pump in the additional money? Not really.</p>\n<p>Remember, between the SPAN and Exposure margin; the most sacred one is the SPAN margin. Most brokers allow you to continue to hold your positions as long as you have the SPAN Margin (or maintenance margin). The moment the cash balance falls below the maintenance margin, they will call you asking you to pump in more money. In the absence of which, they will force close the positions themselves. This call that the broker makes requesting you to pump in the required margin money is also popularly called the “<b>Margin Call</b>”. If you are getting a margin call from your broker, it means your cash balance is dangerously low to continue the position.</p>\n<p>Going back to the example, the cash balance of Rs.27,159/- is above the SPAN margin (Rs.17,438/-); hence there is no problem. The M2M loss is debited from the trading account, and the reference rate for the next day’s M2M is reset to Rs.930/-.</p>\n<p>Well, I hope you have got a sense of how both margins and M2M come into play simultaneously.  I also hope you can appreciate how under the margins and M2M, the exchange can efficiently tackle a possible default threat. The margin + M2M combination is virtually a foolproof method to ensure defaults don’t occur.</p>\n<p>Assuming you are getting a sense of the dynamics of margins and M2M calculation, I will now take the liberty to cut through the remaining days and proceed directly to the last day of trade.</p>\n<p><b>19</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b> Dec 2014</b></p>\n<p>At 955, the trader decides to cash out and square off the trade. The reference rate for M2M is the previous day’s closing rate which is Rs.938. So the M2M profit would Rs.4250/- which gets added to the previous day cash balance of Rs.29,159/-. The final cash balance of Rs.33,409/- (Rs.29,159 + Rs.4250) will be released by the broker as soon as the trader squares off the trade.</p>\n<p>So what about the overall P&amp;L of the trade? Well, there are many ways to calculate this –</p>\n<p><b>Method 1) – Sum up all the M2M’s</b></p>\n<p>P&amp;L = Sum of all M2M’s</p>\n<p>= 325 – 250 – 2250 + 4750 – 4000 – 2000 + 3250 + 4250</p>\n<p><b>= Rs.4,075/-</b></p>\n<p><b>Method 2) – Cash Release</b></p>\n<p>P&amp;L = Final Cash balance (released by broker) – Cash Blocked Initially (initial margin)</p>\n<p>= 33409 – 29334</p>\n<p><b>= Rs.4,075/-</b></p>\n<p><b>Method 3) – Contract Value</b></p>\n<p>P&amp;L = Final Contract Value – Initial Contract Value</p>\n<p>= Rs.238,750 – Rs.234,675</p>\n<p><b>=Rs.4,075/-</b></p>\n<p><b>Method 4) – Futures Price</b></p>\n<p>P&amp;L = (Difference b/w the futures buy &amp; sell price ) * Lot Size</p>\n<p>Buy Price = 938.7, Sell Price = 955, Lot size = 250</p>\n<p>= 16.3 * 250</p>\n<p><b>= Rs. 4,075/-</b></p>\n<p>As you can notice, either of which ways you calculate, you arrive at the same P&amp;L value.</p>\n<h2>5.5 – An interesting case of ‘Margin Call.’</h2>\n<p>For a moment, let us assume the trade was not closed on 19<sup>th</sup> Dec, and in fact, carried forward to the next day, i.e.<b> 20</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b> Dec</b>. Also, let us assume HDFC Bank drops heavily on 20<sup>th </sup>December – maybe an 8% drop, dragging the price to 880 all the way from 955. What do you think will happen? In fact, can you answer the following questions?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the M2M P&amp;L?</li>\n<li>What is the impact on cash balance?</li>\n<li>What is the SPAN and Exposure margin required?</li>\n<li>What action does the broker take?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope you can calculate and answer these questions yourself; if not, here are the answers for you –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The M2M loss would be Rs.18,750/- = (955 – 880)*250. The cash balance on 19<sup>th</sup> Dec was Rs. 33,409/- from which the M2M loss would be deducted, making the cash balance Rs.14,659/- (Rs.33,409 – Rs.18,750).</li>\n<li>Since the price has dropped, the new contract value would be Rs.220,000/- (250*880)\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>SPAN = 7.5% * 220000 = Rs.16,500/-</li>\n<li>Exposure = Rs.11,000/-</li>\n<li>Total Margin = Rs.27,500/-</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Clearly, since the cash balance (Rs.14,659/-) is less than SPAN Margin (Rs.16,500/-), the broker will give a Margin Call to the client, or in fact, some brokers will even cut the position in real-time as and when the cash balance drops below the SPAN requirement.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>A margin payment is required (which will be blocked by your broker) as long as the futures trade is live.</li>\n<li>The margin blocked by the broker at the time of initiating the futures trade is called the initial margin.</li>\n<li>Both the buyer and the seller of the futures agreement will have to deposit the initial margin amount.</li>\n<li>The margin amount collected acts as leverage, as it allows you to deposit a small amount of money and take exposure to a large value transaction.</li>\n<li>M2M is a simple accounting adjustment; the process involves crediting or debiting the daily obligation money in your trading account based on how the futures price behaves.</li>\n<li>The previous day closing price figure is taken to calculate the current day’s M2M.</li>\n<li>SPAN Margin is the margin collected as per the exchanges instruction, and the Exposure Margin is collected as per the broker’s requirement</li>\n<li>The SPAN and Exposure Margin are determined as per the norms of the exchange.</li>\n<li>The SPAN Margin is popularly referred to as the Maintenance Margin.</li>\n<li>If the margin account goes below the SPAN, the investor must deposit more cash into his account if he aspires to carry forward the future position.</li>\n<li>The Margin Call is when the broker requests the trader to infuse the required margin money when the cash balance goes below the required level.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

Over the next two chapters, we will discuss the margin calculator and learn a few associated topics related to margins.</p>\n<p>Do recollect, in the previous chapter, we learnt about the various types of margins required to initiate a futures trade. Margins vary from one future contract to another as the margins depend on the volatility of the underlying. We will talk about volatility in the next module, but for now, remember that the volatility changes from one underlying to another; hence the margins vary from one underlying to another. So how do we know what is the margin requirement of a particular contract? Well, if you are trading with Zerodha, chances are you would have come across the ‘Margin Calculator’.</p>\n<p>Zerodha’s margin calculator is one of our popular offerings, and rightly so. It is a simple to use tool that has a very sophisticated engine in the background.  In this chapter, I will introduce you to the margin calculator and help you understand the margin requirement for the contract you choose. We will revisit this topic on the margin calculator when we take up the chapter on Options in the next module; at that point, we will understand Zerodha’s margin calculator’s complete versatility.</p>\n<p>Let us take up a case where one decides to buy the futures contract of IDEA Cellular Limited, expiring on 29<sup>th</sup> January 2015. Now to initiate this trade, one needs to deposit the initial margin amount. We also know that the Initial Margin (IM) = SPAN Margin + Exposure Margin. To find out the IM requirement, all you need to do is this –</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – The link to the Margin Calculator is <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/margin-calculator/SPAN/\">https://zerodha.com/margin-calculator/SPAN/</a>. As you can see from the image below, many different options are available (I have highlighted the same in black). However, our focus, for now, will be on the first two options called ‘SPAN’ and ‘Equity Futures”. In fact, you will land on the SPAN Margin Calculator subpage by default, highlighted in red.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart2.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch6-chart2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1499\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"348\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart2.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart2-300x131.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – The SPAN Margin Calculator has two main sections within it; let us inspect the same –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart3.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch6-chart3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1500\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"351\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart3.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart3-300x132.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The red section has 3 drops down menu options. The ‘Exchange’ dropdown option basically requires you to choose the exchange you wish to operate. Select –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>NFO if you wish to trade Futures on NSE,</li>\n<li>MCX if you wish to trade commodity futures on MCX</li>\n<li>CDS if you wish to trade currency derivatives on NSE</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The next drop down on your right is the ‘Product’; choose Futures if you wish to trade a futures contract, or if you wish to trade options, select Options. The third drop-down menu lists symbols where all the futures and options contracts are made available. From this drop-down menu, choose the contract you wish to trade. Since we are interested in IDEA Cellular Limited expiring on 29<sup>th</sup> Jan, I have selected the same; please see the image below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart4.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch6-chart4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1501\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"362\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart4.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart4-300x136.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Once you select the futures contract, the Net Quantity automatically gets pre-populated to 1 lot. If you wish to trade more than one lot, you need to enter the new quantity manually. Notice in the image below, as soon as I select the IDEA futures contract, the net quality has changed to the respective lot size, 2000. If I wish to trade, say 3 lots, I have to type in 6000 (2000 * 3). Once this is done, click on the radio button, either a buy or sell (depending on what you wish to do) and finally click on the blue “Add” button</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart5.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch6-chart5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1502\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"348\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart5.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart5-300x131.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Once you instruct the SPAN calculator to add the margins, it will do the same, and it will give you the split up between the SPAN, Exposure, and the total initial margin. This is as shown below, highlighted in the red box –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart6.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch6-chart6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1503\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"351\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart6.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart6-300x132.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The SPAN calculator is suggesting the following –</p>\n<p>SPAN Margin = Rs.22,160/-</p>\n<p>Exposure Margin = Rs.14,730/-</p>\n<p>Initial Margin (SPAN + Exp) = Rs.36,890/-</p>\n<p>With this, you know how much money is required to initiate the futures trade on IDEA Cellular; it is as simple as that! The next interesting section within the margin calculator is the “Equity Futures”. We will discuss the same in the next chapter. However, before we understand this, let us quickly understand 3 more topics, namely the Expiry, Spreads, and Intraday order types. Once we understand these topics, we will be placed better to understand the “Equity Futures” on the margin calculator.</p>\n<h2>6.2 – Expiry</h2>\n<p>In the earlier chapters, we briefly figured out what the ‘Expiry’ of a futures contract means. Expiry specifies the last date up to which the contract lasts, beyond which it will cease to exist. Consider this; if I buy IDEA Cellular Limited futures contract at 149/- expiring on 29<sup>th</sup> January 2015, with an expectation that it will hit 155, it simply means that this move to 155 has to pan out by 29<sup>th</sup> January 2015. Obviously, if the price of IDEA is below 149 before the expiry, then I have to book a loss. Even if the price of IDEA futures hits 155 (or in fact any price above 149) on 30<sup>th</sup> January 2015 (1 day after the expiry), it is of no use to me as the contract has already expired. In simple words, when I buy a futures contract, it has to move in my favour on or before the expiry day, else there is no point.</p>\n<p>Does it really have to be so rigid? Is there any flexibility in terms of going beyond the stated expiry date? Let me illustrate what I mean –</p>\n<p>I know that the Central Government budget is expected sometime around the last week of February 2015, which is a little more than a month away (considering today is 19<sup>th</sup> Jan 2015). I expect a good budget this time around, and I’m hopeful that the manufacturing sector will significantly benefit from the budget in the backdrop of the ‘Make in India’ campaign. Given this, I would like to bet that Bharat Forge, a manufacturing major, will significantly benefit from the upcoming budget. To be precise, I expect Bharat Forge to rally from now, all the way till the budget (pre-budget rally). Therefore to exploit my directional perspective on Bharat Forge, I would like to buy its futures today. Have a look at the snapshot below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart7.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch6-chart7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1504\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"514\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart7.jpg 575w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart7-300x268.jpg 300w\" width=\"575\"/></a></p>\n<p>Bharat Forge  January 2015 contract is trading at Rs.1022/-, but here is a situation – my view is that Bharat Forge will rally from now, all the way till the last week of Feb 2015. But If I buy the futures contract, as shown above, it expires on 29<sup>th</sup> Jan 2015, leaving me stranded halfway through.</p>\n<p>Clearly, since my directional view goes beyond the January expiry period, I need not be bound to buy the January expiry contract. In fact, for reasons similar to this, NSE allows you to select a contract that suits the expiry requirement.</p>\n<p>At any given point, NSE allows us to buy a futures contract with 3 different expiries. For example, we are in January; hence we have 3 contracts of Bharat Forge with different expiry –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>29<sup>th</sup> January 2015 – This is called the <strong>near month</strong> contract or the <strong>current month</strong> contract</li>\n<li>26<sup>th</sup> February 2015 – This is called the <strong>mid-month</strong> contract</li>\n<li>26<sup>th</sup> March 2015 – This is called the <strong>far month</strong> contract</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Have a look at the image below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart8.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch6-chart8\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1505\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"511\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart8.jpg 572w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart8-300x268.jpg 300w\" width=\"572\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, from the expiry drop-down menu, I can choose any contract between the current month, mid-month, or far month based on my specific requirement. Needless to say, I would choose the mid-month contract expiring on 26<sup>th</sup> Feb 2015 in this particular case (as shown below) –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart9.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch6-chart9\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1506\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"508\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart9.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart9.jpg 571w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart9-300x267.jpg 300w\" width=\"571\"/></a></p>\n<p>One thing that stands out clearly is the change in futures price. The contract expires on 26<sup>th</sup> Feb 2015 is trading at Rs.1,032/- while at the same time the contract expiring on 29<sup>th</sup> Jan is trading at Rs.1,022.8/-. Which means the mid-month contract is more expensive compared to the current month contract. This is always the case; the larger the time to expiry, the higher is the price. In fact, as I write this, Bharat Forge Limited’s March contract expiring on 29<sup>th</sup> March 2015 is trading at Rs.1,037.4/-.</p>\n<p>For now, remember this – The current month futures price should be less than mid-month futures price, which should be less than far month futures price. There is a mathematical reason for this; the same will be discussed when we take up the futures pricing formula.</p>\n<p>Also, here is another important concept you need to remember – As I had mentioned earlier, at any given point, the NSE ensures there are 3 future contracts (current, mid, and far month) available to trade. For now, we know, Bharat Forge contract is expiring on 29<sup>th </sup>January 2015. This means the January contract can be traded till 3:30 PM on 29<sup>th</sup> January 2015, after which it will cease to exist. Does that mean from 29<sup>th</sup> January 2015 onwards, the January contract goes out of the system leaving behind just the February and March contract?</p>\n<p>Not really; till 3:30 PM on January 29<sup>th</sup> 2015, the January contract is available, after which it will expire. On 9:15 AM 30<sup>th</sup> January 2015, NSE will introduce April 2015 contract. So on 30<sup>th</sup> January, we will have three contracts –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The February contract would now graduate as the current month contract from the mid-month contract until the previous day.</li>\n<li>The March contract would now be considered the mid-month contract (graduated from being the far month the previous day to a mid-month now)</li>\n<li>The April contract, which is newly introduced, becomes the far month contract.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Likewise, when the February contract expires, NSE will introduce the May contract. Hence the market will have March, April, and May contracts to trade. So on and so forth.</p>\n<p>Anyway, continuing with Bharat Forge Limited futures contract example, because I have a slightly longer-term view, I can buy the futures contract expiring on 26<sup>th</sup> February 2015 and hold the February contract till I deem appropriate. However, there is another alternative, as well. Instead of buying the February contract, I can buy the January contract, hold on to it until around expiry and very close to expiry. I can square off the January contract and buy the February contract. This is called a ‘<strong>rollover</strong>’.</p>\n<p>If you watch business news regularly, the TV anchor usually talks about the ‘rollover data’ around the expiry time. Well, don’t get too confused about this; in fact, it is quite straight forward. They are trying to convey a % measure of how many traders have ‘rolled over’ (or carried over) their existing positions from the current month to the mid-month. If many traders are rolling over their existing long positions to the next month, it is considered bullish; likewise, if many traders are rolling over their existing short positions to the next month, it is considered bearish. This is as simple as that. Now is this a proven technique to draw any concrete inference about the markets? Not really; it is just a perception of the market.</p>\n<p>So under what circumstances would one want to roll over rather than buy a long-dated futures contract? One of the main reasons for this is the ease of buying and selling, aka ‘The liquidity. In simple words, at any given point, there is more number of traders who prefer to trade the current month contract as compared to the mid or far month contract. Obviously, when more traders are trading the same contract, the ease of buying and selling gets better.</p>\n<h2>6.3 – Sneak Peek into Spreads</h2>\n<p>We are now at an exciting stage. You may find some of the discussion below a bit confusing, but just read through this and try to grasp as much as you can. At the right time in future, we will talk more about this in detail.</p>\n<p>Just think about these two contracts –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bharat Forge Limited Futures, expiring on 29<sup>th</sup> January 2015</li>\n<li>Bharat Forge Limited Futures, expiring on 26<sup>th</sup> February 2015</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are two different contracts for all practical purposes, priced slightly differently; both derive its value from the same underlying, i.e. Bharat Forge Limited, hence they behave the same. If Bharat Forge stock price in the spot market goes up, then both January futures and February futures price would go up. Likewise, if Bharat Forge stock price in the spot market goes down, then both January futures and February futures price would go down.</p>\n<p>At times there are opportunities created whereby simultaneously buying the current month contract and selling the mid-month contract or vice versa, one can make money. Opportunities of this type are called ‘Calendar Spreads’. How to identify such opportunities and setup trades is a different topic altogether. We will discuss this soon. But at this moment, I want to draw your attention to the margins aspect.</p>\n<p>We know why margins are charged – mainly from the risk management perspective. What kind of risk would exist if we are buying the contract on the one hand and selling the same type of contract on the other? The risk is drastically reduced. Let me illustrate this with numbers –</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Trader buys only Bharat Forge Limited’s January Futures.</strong></p>\n<p>Bharat Forge Spot Price = Rs.1021/- per share</p>\n<p>Bharat Forge January contract Price= Rs.1023/- per share</p>\n<p>Lot Size = 250</p>\n<p>After buying, assume the spot price drops to Rs.1011/- (10 point fall)</p>\n<p>Approximate futures price = Rs.1013/-</p>\n<p>P&amp;L = <span style=\"color: red;\">(10 * 250)</span> = Rs.2500/- loss</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Trader buys January and sells February Futures.</strong></p>\n<p>Bharat Forge Spot Price = Rs.1021/- per share</p>\n<p>Long on Bharat Forge January contract at Rs.1023/- per share.</p>\n<p>Short on Bharat Forge February contract at Rs.1033/- per share</p>\n<p>Lot Size = 250</p>\n<p>After setting up this trade, assume the spot price drops to 1011 (10 point fall)</p>\n<p>Approximate price of January Futures = Rs.1013/-</p>\n<p>Approximate price of February Futures = Rs.1023/-</p>\n<p>P&amp;L on January Contract = <span style=\"color: red;\">(10*250)</span> = Rs.2500/- loss</p>\n<p>P&amp;L on February Contract = 10*250 = Rs.2500/- profit</p>\n<p><strong>Net P&amp;L = – 2500 + 2500 = 0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Trader sells January and buys February Futures.</strong></p>\n<p>Bharat Forge Spot Price = Rs.1021/- per share</p>\n<p>Short on Bharat Forge January contract at Rs.1023/- per share</p>\n<p>Long on Bharat Forge February contract at Rs.1033/- per share.</p>\n<p>Lot Size = 250</p>\n<p>After setting up this trade, assume the spot price increases to 1031 (10 point increase)</p>\n<p>Approximate price of January Futures = Rs.1033/-</p>\n<p>Approximate price of February Futures = Rs.1043/-</p>\n<p>P&amp;L on January Contract = <span style=\"color: red;\">(10*250)</span> = Rs.2500/- Loss</p>\n<p>P&amp;L on February Contract =(10*250)= Rs.2500 /- Profit</p>\n<p><strong>Net P&amp;L = – 2500 + 2500 = 0</strong></p>\n<p>Clearly, the point that I’m trying to make here is that when you are long on one contract and short on another contract, the risk is virtually reduced to zero. However, it is not completely risk-free; one has to account for the liquidity, volatility, execution risk, etc. But by and large, the risk reduces drastically. So when risk reduces drastically, the margins should also reduce drastically.</p>\n<p>In fact, this is what happens, have a look at the following snapshots –</p>\n<p>This is the margin requirement (Rs.37,362/-) when we intend to buy January contracts of Bharat Forge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart10.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch6-chart10\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1507\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"310\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart10.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart10.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart10-300x116.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is the margin requirement (Rs.37,629/-) when we intend to sell February contracts of Bharat Forge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart11.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch6-chart11\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"306\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart11.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart11-300x115.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>And this is the margin requirement (Rs.7,213/-) when we intend to buy January contract and sell February contract simultaneously.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart12.jpg\"><img alt=\"M4-Ch6-chart12\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1509\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"274\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart12.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart12.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/M4-Ch6-chart12-300x137.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, individually, the January and February contracts require Rs.37,362/- and Rs.37,629/- respectively. Hence a total of Rs.74,991/-. However, when a futures contract is bought and sold simultaneously, the risk reduces drastically, hence the margin requirement. As we can see from the image above, the combined position requires a margin of Rs.7,213/- only. Another way to look at it would be from a total of Rs.74,991/-, Rs.67,658/- i.e. Margin Benefit (highlighted in black) is reduced, and the benefit is passed on to the client. But do remember this – A simultaneous long and short position is built only when opportunities arise. These opportunities are called the ‘Calendar Spread’. If the calendar spread opportunity is not there, then there is no point initiating such trades.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key Takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Zerodha’s margin calculator is a simple tool that lets you calculate the margin required for a futures contract.</li>\n<li>The margin calculator has many versatile features inbuilt.</li>\n<li>The margin calculator gives the split up between the SPAN and Exposure margin.</li>\n<li>At any given point, NSE ensures there are three contracts of the same underlying, which expire on 3 different (but consecutive) months.</li>\n<li>A trader can choose the contract of his choice based on the expiry date.</li>\n<li>The contract belonging to the present month is called ‘Current Month Contract’, the next month contract is called ‘Mid Month’, and the 3<sup>rd</sup> one is called “Far Month Contract.’</li>\n<li>On every expiry, the current month contract expires and a new far month contract is introduced.

Before you get annoyed and come chasing me, let me post the answer.</p>\n<p>Margins are charged from a risk management perspective. It helps in preventing any undesired counterparty default. The risk management system at the broker’s office (often called the RMS system) is responsible for overseeing the overall risk management. You may be interested to know that the RMS is a computer program, and all orders placed by the clients reach the exchange only once this program approves it (which takes a fraction of a second), and people are monitoring if everything done is right/wrong.</p>\n<p>When you place a trade, let us say to buy a futures contract (via a buy order entry form), you are essentially conveying the following details to the risk management system (RMS) –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The contract you wish to buy (like TCS futures, IDEA futures etc.)</li>\n<li>The quantity you wish to buy ( number of lots)</li>\n<li>The price at which you want to buy (market or limit)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once you place the order, the RMS system evaluates the margin requirement and allows your trade to go through (provided you have the required margin amount).</p>\n<p>However, the information that you <strong>don’t normally</strong> provide to the RMS system is the following –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The duration up to which you wish to hold your trade – is your trade intraday, or you would wish to hold on to it over multiple days?</li>\n<li>The stoploss point – If the trade goes against you, at what price point you would wish to book a loss and square off the position.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, what would happen if you provided these additional details to the RMS system? Obviously, with the additional information flowing to the RMS system, it would better clarify your risk appetite.</p>\n<p>For example, the detail on the <b>trade duration</b> would let the system know how much volatility you are exposed to. If your trade is intraday, you are only exposed to 1-day volatility. However, if your trade is for multiple days, you are exposed to multiple days volatility and are also exposed to the ‘overnight risk’.</p>\n<p>Overnight risk is the risk of carrying the position overnight. For example, assume I’m holding a long BPCL (a major oil marketing company in India) futures position overnight. BPCL is highly sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil prices. While I’m holding the BPCL futures, assume overnight the crude oil market shoots up by 5%. This will obviously harm BPCL the next day as it becomes more expensive for BPCL to buy crude oil from the international markets. Hence under holding a BPCL position overnight, I will suffer a loss. Therefore an M2M cut. This is called ‘overnight risk’. Anyway, the point that I’m trying to make here is straightforward – from the RMS system’s perspective, the longer you wish to hold the trade, the higher is the risk you are exposed to.</p>\n<p>Likewise, think about the <strong>stoploss</strong> <strong>for the trade</strong>. By <strong>not </strong>expressing your intended stoploss, you keep the RMS system in total darkness concerning your risk appetite. Do note; this is not mandatory information that you need to reveal. However, if you do, the RMS system gets more clarity on your trade. For example, assume I buy BPCL futures Rs.649/-, in the absence of specifying a stoploss, I’m virtually exposed to unlimited risk. However, if I specify my stoploss as, let us say, Rs.9/-, then when BPCL falls to Rs.640/- (649 – 9), I would book a loss and get out of the trade. Hence, there is complete clarity on the amount of risk I’m willing to take, which is valuable information from the RMS system’s perspective.</p>\n<p>So both – the duration and the stoploss of the trade give more clarity about your risk appetite to the RMS system. So what does this mean to you as a trader?</p>\n<p>Well, think about it – the more clarity you provide in terms of the risk you face, the higher clarity the RMS system develops. The more clarity it has, the lesser the margins required!</p>\n<p>Very loosely put, think about this as an equivalent to shopping for television at a consumer electronics store. I know this may not be very apt, but I hope the following analogy gives you the right message.</p>\n<p>If you go to a consumer electronics store and inquire about a television’s price, the seller will assume you are a regular customer, and he will quote the normal selling price. However, if you tell him that you are likely to purchase 50 televisions, he will instantly drop the price.</p>\n<p>If you tell him you are carrying the cash with you and are willing to finish the transaction right away, he will drop both his jaws and the prices even lower. The point is – as and when the shop keeper gets more information about the transaction, the more attractive the price gets.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M4-Ch7-cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1562\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/M4-Ch7-cartoon.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/M4-Ch7-cartoon.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/M4-Ch7-cartoon-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>7.2 – Product types</h2>\n<p>So far, one thing is clear, the more information (in terms of risk) you are willing to convey to the RMS system, the lesser is the margin required. Needless to say, the lesser the margins required, the more you can do with your capital. So, how does a trader convey this information to the RMS system? Well, there are specific product types that are meant for this purpose. While placing an order (to either buy or sell), you can specify the product type. There are many Product types, and they vary from one another, mainly in terms of their functionality and the information they convey to the RMS system. While the core functionality of these product types is standard, every broker calls them with different names. Of course, I will talk about the product types used at Zerodha; if you are still trading with another broker, I will request you to speak to them and identify the nomenclature used.</p>\n<p><strong>NRML – </strong>NRML is a standard product type. Use this when you intend to buy and hold the futures trade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image1_Product-Type.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image1_Product Type\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1563\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"154\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image1_Product-Type.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image1_Product-Type.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image1_Product-Type-300x58.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Remember, when you use NRML, the risk management system has no additional information on your trade length (as you can continue to hold the contract till expiry), nor does it have any information on the stoploss. You suffer losses (and therefore continue to pump in the required margins). Hence because of the lack of clarity, the broker’s RMS system charges you the full margins (i.e. SPAN and Exposure).</p>\n<p>Use NRML when you intend to buy and hold the futures position over multiple days.  However, do remember you can use NRML product type for intraday as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Margin Intraday Square off (MIS) – </strong>Zerodha’s MIS is a pure intraday product, meaning all trades placed as MIS product type will indicate that the trade will last only for the day. You cannot select MIS as an order type and expect the position to be carried forward to the next day. You have to mandatorily cut the position by 3:20 PM, failing which the RMS system will do the same.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image2_MIS.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image2_MIS\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1564\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"147\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image2_MIS.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image2_MIS.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image2_MIS-300x55.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now because the product type is MIS, the RMS system clearly knows that it is an intraday trade, which is a notch better than NRML <strong>in terms of information flow</strong>. Remember, when the trade is intraday, the trader is exposed to only 1 day’s volatility. Hence the margin requirement is lower compared to the NRML margins.</p>\n<p><strong>Cover order (CO) – </strong>The concept of cover order is simple. First, similar to MIS, the cover order (CO) is also an intraday product. However, the CO conveys additional information in terms of stoploss. This means, at the time of placing a CO, you will have to specify the stoploss as well. Hence CO conveys both the vital information –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The length of the trade, which is intraday</li>\n<li>The stoploss, which is the maximum loss you will bear in case the trade moves against you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The snapshot below shows the buy CO form –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image3_CO.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image3_CO\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1565\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"285\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image3_CO.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image3_CO.jpg 620w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image3_CO-300x138.jpg 300w\" width=\"620\"/></a></p>\n<p>The area highlighted in black is where one is required to specify the stoploss. Of course, I will not get into the logistics bit, explaining how to place a CO from the trading terminal, as we have already done that through an <strong><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/z-connect/tradezerodha/zerodha-trader-software-version/cover-orders-for-higher-leverage%20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">article</a></strong> in <em>z-connect</em>. <strong> </strong></p>\n<p>I want you to be aware of this – by placing a CO, you are not only conveying that your trade is intraday but also conveying the maximum loss you are willing to bear. Hence under this, the margins should drop considerably (even lower than MIS).</p>\n<p><strong>Bracket Order (BO)</strong> – The bracket order is quite versatile. Consider the BO as an improvisation over the cover order. Needless to say, a BO is an intraday order, which means all BO orders have to be squared off within the day on or before 3:20 PM. While placing a BO, you will have to mention a few other things –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The stoploss – At what place you would like to get out of the trade-in case the trade moves against you</li>\n<li>The Trailing stoploss – This is an optional feature where you can trail your stoploss. We have not spoken about “The trailing stoploss” so far. We will discuss the same towards the end of this chapter. But for now, remember the BO gives you an option to trail your stoploss; in fact, this is one of the most popular features of a BO.</li>\n<li>Target – If the trade moves in your favour, the BO also requires you to specify the price at which you would like to book the profits</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The BO sends your order to the exchange, where simultaneously you can specify the target and the stoploss. This is a huge relief to active traders as it helps them in many ways. Of course, for the logistics bit on how to place a BO, you can check out this <strong><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/z-connect/tradezerodha/zerodha-trader-software-version/bracket-orders-trailing-stoploss-sl\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">article</a></strong> as it beautifully explains what needs to be done.</p>\n<p>The snapshot below shows the BO buy order form; the green box highlights the SL placements –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image4_BO.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image4_BO\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1566\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"249\" sizes=\"(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image4_BO.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image4_BO.jpg 697w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image4_BO-300x107.jpg 300w\" width=\"697\"/></a></p>\n<p>If you think about the Bracket Order, the trader conveys the same set of information to the RMS system as that of the CO. Besides, through the BO, the trader is also conveying the target price. Now, what difference does the information on the target price make to the RMS system? Well, it literally makes no difference to it from the risk management perspective. Remember, the RMS is only worried about your risk and not your reward. Hence, for this reason, the margin charged for BO and CO is the same.</p>\n<p>Let us now keep the above discussion in perspective and look into a few other options available on Zerodha’s margin calculator.</p>\n<h2>7.3 – Back to the Margin Calculator</h2>\n<p>Here is a quick recap – in the previous chapter, we introduced Zerodha’s margin calculator.  The objective of the margin calculator is straight forward. It helps the trader figure out how much margin is required for the contract he wishes to trade. In our quest to understand the same, we also understood concepts of expiry, rollover, and spread margins. With this chapter’s help, we are now clear about the information flow to the RMS system and its impact on the applicable margins. Let us keep these in perspective and look at the other two options highlighted in red in the margin calculator – “Equity Futures” and “BO&amp;CO”. Here is a snapshot highlighting these features –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image5_MC.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image5_MC\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1567\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"356\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image5_MC.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image5_MC.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image5_MC-300x134.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Equity Futures – </strong>The equity futures section in the margin calculator is a ready reckoner, as it helps the trader understand the following –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The NRML margin required for a particular contract</li>\n<li>The MIS margin required for a particular contract</li>\n<li>The number of lots that a trader can buy for the given amount of money in his trading account</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Equity Futures section contains nearly 475 contracts (as of January 2015). To understand this better, let us take up a few tasks. We will solve these tasks by using the Equity Futures section of the margin calculator. And hopefully, in the process, you will understand how to use the section better.</p>\n<p><strong>Task 1</strong> – A trader has Rs.80,000/- in his trading account. He wants to buy ACC Cements Limited Futures expiring 26<sup>th</sup> February 2015 and hold the same for 3 trading sessions. Find out the margin requirement for this contract. He also wants to trade Infosys January futures for intraday; what is the margin required? Does he have sufficient margins to initiate both the trades?</p>\n<p><em>Solution</em> – Let us deal with the ACC futures first. Since the trader intends to hold the futures contract for 3 working days, we need to look for NRML margins. Do note; this task can be achieved by using the SPAN calculator as well. We discussed this in the previous chapter. However, the Equity Futures calculator has a few more advantages over a SPAN calculator.</p>\n<p>Visit the Equity Futures section, and you can see all the contacts listed here; scroll till you find the desired contract. I have highlighted the same in green. Do notice; the calculator is also listing the contract’s expiry date, lot size, and the price at which the contract is trading.</p>\n<p>The black vertical box highlights the NRML margin for each contract.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image6_EQ1.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image6_EQ1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1568\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"312\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image6_EQ1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image6_EQ1.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image6_EQ1-300x117.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>From the table, it is clear that the ACC Feb 2015 requires a margin of Rs.48,686/-.</p>\n<p>To determine the margin requirement for Infosys, I need to scroll down till I spot Infosys January contracts or type “Infy” in the search box provided.</p>\n<p>As we can see, Infy’s NRML margin is Rs.67,698/-(highlighted in the black arrow), and MIS margin is Rs.27,079/-(highlighted in the red arrow). Do note the MIS margin amount is drastically lower compared to the NRML margin,</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image7_EQInfy.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image7_EQInfy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1569\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"352\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image7_EQInfy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image7_EQInfy.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image7_EQInfy-300x132.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Clearly, since the trade is for intraday, the trader can choose MIS product type and benefit from a lower margin requirement, which is Rs.27,079/-. Do note; the trader can select NRML product type even for intraday; there is no harm doing so. But when one does this, the NRML margin amount gets blocked. If one is clear in his mind about the intraday trade, then it makes sense to opt for MIS and efficiently use the capital available.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the trader’s total margin requirement would be –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>48,686/- towards the ACC contract (NRML margin as the trader wishes to hold the position for 3 days)</li>\n<li>27,079/- towards the Infosys contract (MIS margins as it is a pure intraday product).</li>\n<li>Total margin of Rs.75,765/- (48,686 + 27079)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Clearly, since the trader has Rs.80,000/- in his account, he can initiate both the trades.</p>\n<p><strong>Task 2 – </strong>A trader has Rs.120,000/- in his trading account. How many lots of Wipro January Futures can he buy on an intraday basis and a multiple-day base?</p>\n<p><em>Solution</em> – Search for Wipro in the search box provided. Next to the MIS margin column, there is an option to click on “Calculate” (highlighted in green arrow). Click on the same.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image8_EQ.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image8_EQ\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1570\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"362\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image8_EQ.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image8_EQ.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image8_EQ-300x136.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>After you click on it, a form sort of window opens up; you need to enter –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The amount of cash in your trading account (by default, this is set to Rs.100,000/- you can edit the same to meet your requirement)</li>\n<li>The price at which the contract is trading (in fact, this is pre-populated)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Have a look at the screenshot below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image9_EQ.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image9_EQ\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1571\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"260\" sizes=\"(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image9_EQ.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image9_EQ.jpg 614w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image9_EQ-300x127.jpg 300w\" width=\"614\"/></a></p>\n<p>The calculator suggests that I can trade up to 3 lots of Wipro futures under the NRML product type, considering NRML margin is Rs.36,806/- per lot. Under the MIS product type, I can trade up to 8 lots, considering the margin requirement is just Rs.14,722/- per lot.</p>\n<p>And with that, we know all the Equity Futures section of the margin calculator’s functionalities, as easy as that. We now move over to the BO&amp;CO calculator.</p>\n<h2>7.4 – BO&amp;CO Margin Calculator</h2>\n<p>Both bracket order and cover order have similar margin requirements for reasons we discussed earlier. Using the BO&amp;CO calculator is quite simple; it is quite similar to the SPAN calculator. In the following snapshot, I’m trying to calculate the margin requirement for Biocon Futures expiring in February 2015. Notice, I have selected everything that I need to, except for the stoploss.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image10_BOCO.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image10_BOCO\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1572\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"309\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image10_BOCO.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image10_BOCO.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image10_BOCO-300x116.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Without selecting the stoploss, I proceed and press the ‘calculate’ button. When I do so, the calculator calculates the default stoploss that one can choose and the margin required. Now once I mention the stop loss, the calculator calculates the amount as shown below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image11_Boco.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image11_Boco\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1573\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"307\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image11_Boco.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image11_Boco.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image11_Boco-300x115.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>As per the BO&amp;CO calculator, the stoploss one can choose Rs.403. Of course, you can vary the stoploss to any point, and the margins will change accordingly.  Anyway, the margin required is Rs.9,062/-, which is remarkably lower compared to NRML margin of Rs.26,135/- and MIS margin of Rs.11,545.</p>\n<h2>7.5 – The trailing stoploss</h2>\n<p>Before we conclude this chapter, let us briefly discuss the ‘trailing stoploss’. The concept of trailing stoploss finds its application in bracket orders and, in general, plays a crucial role while trading. Hence I guess it is important to know how to trail your stoploss. Consider this situation (in fact, most of us would have been in this situation) – you buy a stock at Rs.250, with an expectation that the stock price will hit Rs.270 sooner or later. You keep a stoploss at Rs.240 (just in case the trade goes against you) and hope for the best.</p>\n<p>Things move as expected; the stock rallies all the way from Rs.250 to Rs.265 (just a few Rupees away from your target of Rs.270), however thanks to market volatility, it starts to retrace back…all the way to hit your stoploss at Rs.240. So, in essence, you saw profits coming in for a brief while but were eventually forced to book a loss. How do you deal with such a situation? More often than not, we are always put in such a spot where we are right about the overall direction but get ‘stopped out’ due to market volatility.</p>\n<p>Well, thanks to the technique of ‘trailing your stop loss, you can prevent yourself from being in this situation. In fact, at times, trailing stoploss gives you a chance of making a better profit than you originally thought about.</p>\n<p>Trailing stoploss is a simple concept. All one needs to do is adjust the stoploss based on the movement in the stock. Let me illustrate this with an example. Here is a typical trade setup –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Trade type</td>\n<td>Long</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Script</td>\n<td>Infosys</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Instrument</td>\n<td>Futures</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Futures Price</td>\n<td>Rs.2175/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Target</td>\n<td>Rs.2220/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stoploss</td>\n<td>Rs.2150/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Risk</td>\n<td>Rs.25 (2175 – 2150)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reward</td>\n<td>Rs.45 (2220 – 2175)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Clearly, the idea is to go long at Rs.2175 and keep a stoploss at Rs.2150. The idea is to adjust the stoploss as and when the price moves in the trade direction. To be precise, for every 15 points of the price movement in the trade direction, the SL can be adjusted accordingly. The SL can be adjusted to any level with an idea of locking in the profits. When you adjust the SL intending to lock the profits, it is called “Trailing Stop Loss”. I was hoping you could note that I have randomly opted for a 15 point move in this example, but in reality, it can be any price move. Please look at the following table; as and when the price moves 15 points in the trades favour, I trail my SL and thereby lock in a certain amount of profit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image12_TSL.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image12_TSL\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1574\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"239\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image12_TSL.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image12_TSL.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image12_TSL-300x90.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Please note that the original price target was Rs.2220, but thanks to the trailing SL technique, I can ride the momentum and close in on a higher profit.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The more information one conveys to the RMS system in terms of trade duration and stoploss; the lesser is the margin requirement.</li>\n<li>Use NRML product type when you want to initiate a trade and carry it overnight.</li>\n<li>NRML margins are the highest (SPAN + Exposure)</li>\n<li>MIS is a pure intraday trade.

However in this chapter we will look at shorting in greater detail. Shorting is a tricky concept because we are not used to shorting in our day to day transaction. For example imagine this transaction – You buy an apartment today for let us say Rs.X, sell it 2 years later for Rs.X+Y. The profit made on the transaction is the incremental value over and above Rs.X, which happens to be Rs.Y. This is a simple and a highly intuitive transaction. In fact most of the day to day transactions requires us to buy something first and sell it later (maybe for a profit or a loss). These are simple to understand transactions and we are used to it. However in a short sale or a just ‘shorting’ we carry out the transactions in the exact opposite direction i.e. to sell first and buy later.</p>\n<p>So what would compel a trader to sell something first and then buy it later? Well, it is quite simple – When we believe the price of an asset such as a stock is likely to increase we buy the stock first and sell it later. However, when we believe the price of the stock is going to decline, we usually sell it first and buy it later!</p>\n<p>Confused? Well, let me try giving you a rudimentary analogy just so that you can get the gist of the concept at this stage. Imagine your friend and you are watching a nail biting India Pakistan cricket match. Both of you are in a mood for a little wager. You bet that India is going to win the match, and your friend bets that India will lose the match. Quite naturally this means you make money if India wins. Likewise your friend would make money if India were to lose the match. Now for a minute think of the India (as in the Indian cricket team in this context) as a stock trading in the stock market. When you do so, your bet is equivalent to saying that you would make money if the stock goes up (India wins the match), and your friend would make money if the stock goes down (India loses the match). In market parlance, you are long on India and your friend is short on India.</p>\n<p>Still confused? May not be I suppose, but I would imagine a few unanswered questions crawling in your mind. If you are completely new to shorting, just remember this one point for now – <b>When you feel the price of a stock is likely to decline, you can make money by shorting the stock. To short stock or futures, you will have to sell first and buy later</b>. In fact the best way to learn shorting is by actually shorting a stock/futures and experiencing the P&amp;L. However in this chapter, I will try and explain all the things you need to know before you go ahead and short the stock/futures.</p>\n<h2>8.2 – Shorting stocks in the spot market</h2>\n<p>Before we understand how one can short a stock in the futures market, we need to understand how shorting works in the spot market. Think about the following hypothetical situation –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A trader looks at the daily chart of HCL Technologies Limited and identifies the formation of a bearish Marubuzo</li>\n<li>Along with  the bearish Marubuzo, other checklist items (as discussed in TA module) complies as well\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Above average volumes</li>\n<li>Presence of the resistance level</li>\n<li>Indicators confirm</li>\n<li>The Risk &amp; Reward ratio is satisfactory</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Based on the analysis the trader is convinced that HCL Technologies will decline by at least 2.0% the following day</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now given this outlook, the trader wants to profit by the expected price decline. Hence he decides to short the stock. Let us understand this better by defining the trade –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Stock</td>\n<td>HCL Technologies</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trade Type</td>\n<td>Short (sell first and buy later)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trade Type</td>\n<td>Short (sell first and buy later)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Trade Duration</td>\n<td>Intra day</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Short Price</td>\n<td>Rs.1990/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Number of shares</td>\n<td>50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Target Price</td>\n<td>Rs.1950/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>% Profit Expected</td>\n<td>2.0%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stoploss</td>\n<td>Rs.2000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Risk</td>\n<td>Rs.10/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reward</td>\n<td>Rs.40/-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As we know, when one shorts a stock or stock futures, the expectation is that the stock price goes down and therefore one can profit out of the falling prices. So from the table above the idea is to short the stock at Rs.1990.</p>\n<p>On the trading platform when you are required to short, all you need to do is highlight the stock (or futures contract) you wish to short and press F2 on your <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/pi/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>trading platform.</strong></a> Doing so invokes the sell order form; enter the quantity and other details before you hit Submit. When you hit submit, the order hits the exchange and assuming it gets filled, you would have created a short open position for yourself.</p>\n<p>Anyway, now think about this – When you enter a trading position, under what circumstances would you make a loss? Well, quite obviously you would lose money when the stock price goes against your expected direction. So,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you short a stock what is the expected directional move?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The expectation is that the stock price would decline, so the directional view is downwards</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>So when would you start making a loss?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>When the stock moves against the expected direction</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>And what would that be?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>This means you will start making a loss if the stock price instead of going down starts to move up</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For this reason whenever you short, the stoploss price is always higher than the price at which you have shorted the stock. Therefore from the table above you can see that the short trade entry is Rs.1990/- and the stoploss is Rs.2000/-, which is Rs.10/- higher than the entry price.</p>\n<p>Now, after initiating the short trade at Rs.1990/- let us now hypothetically imagine 2 scenarios.</p>\n<p><b>Scenario 1 – The stock price hits the target of Rs.1950/-</b></p>\n<p>In this case the stock has moved as per the expectation. The stock has fallen from Rs.1990/- to Rs.1950/-. Since the target has been achieved, the trader is expected to close the position. As we know in a short position the trader is required to –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First sell @ Rs.1990/- and</li>\n<li>Later buy @ Rs.1950/-</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the whole process, the trader would have made a profit equal to the differential between the selling and buying price – i.e. Rs.40/- (1990 – 1950).</p>\n<p>If you look at it from another angle (i.e. the usual buy first and sell later angle), this is as good as buying at Rs.1950 and selling at Rs.1990. It is just that the trader has reversed the transaction order by selling first and buying later.</p>\n<p><b>Scenario 2 – The stock price increases to Rs.2000/-</b></p>\n<p>In this case the stock has gone higher than the short price of Rs.1990/-. Recollect when you short, for you to profit the stock needs to decline in price. If the stock price goes up instead then there would be a loss. In this case the stock has gone up, hence there would be a loss –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The trader shorted @ Rs.1990/-. After shorting, the stock went up as opposed to the trader’s expectation</li>\n<li>The stock hits Rs.2000/- and triggers the stoploss. To prevent further losses, the trader will have to close the position by buying the stock back.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the whole process the trader would have suffered a loss of Rs.10/- (2000 – 1990). If you look at it from the regular buy first sell later angle – this transaction is as good as buying at Rs.2000/- and selling at Rs.1990/ , and again if we reverse the order it would be sell first and buy later.</p>\n<p>Hopefully the above two scenarios should have convinced you about the fact that, when you short you make money when the price goes down and you lose when the price increases.</p>\n<h2>8.3 – Shorting in spot (The stock exchange’s perspective)</h2>\n<p>Shorting in the spot market has one restriction – it strictly has to be done on an intraday basis. Meaning you can initiate the short trade anytime during the day, but you will have to buy back the shares (square off) by end of the day before the market closes. You cannot carry forward the short position for multiple days. To understand why shorting in the spot market is strictly an intraday affair we need to understand how the exchange treats the short position.</p>\n<p>When you short in the spot market, you obviously sell first. The moment you sell a stock, the backend process would alert the exchange that you have sold a particular stock. The exchange does not differentiate between a regular selling of stock (from DEMAT account) and a short sale. From their perspective they are of the opinion that you have sold the shares which would obligate you to deliver the same. In order to do so, you need to keep the shares ready in your DEMAT account by next day. However the exchange would know about your obligation only after the market closes and not during the market hours.</p>\n<p>Keep the above discussion in the back of your mind. Now for a moment let us assume you have shorted a stock and hope to benefit from the price decline. After you short, the price has not declined as expected and hence you decide to wait for another day. However at the end of the day, exchange would figure out that you have sold shares during the day, hence you would be required to keep these shares ready for delivery. However you do not have these shares for meeting your delivery obligation. This means you will default against your obligation; hence there would be a hefty penalty for this default. This situation is also referred to as “Short Delivery”.</p>\n<p>Under a short delivery situation, the exchange would take up the issue and settle it in the auction market. I would encourage you to read this <strong><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/z-connect/queries/stock-and-fo-queries/consequences-of-short-delivery-nse-bse\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> </strong>on Z-Connect which beautifully explains the auction market procedures and how penalty is imposed on the client defaulting on delivery obligation. A piece of advice here, never get into the ‘short delivery’ situation, always make sure you close your short trade before the market close, else the penalty could be as high as 20% above your short price.</p>\n<p>Also, this leads us to an important thought – the exchange anyway checks for the obligations after the market closes. Hence before the exchange can run the ‘obligation check’ if one were to cover the short position (by squaring off) then there would be no obligation at all by end of the day. Hence for this reason, shorting in spot market has to be done strictly as an intraday trade without actually carrying forward the delivery obligation.</p>\n<p>So does that mean all short positions have to be closed within the day? Not really. A short position created in the futures market can be carried forward overnight.</p>\n<h2>8.4 – Shorting in the Futures Market</h2>\n<p>Shorting a stock in the futures segment has no restrictions like shorting the stock in the spot market. In fact this is one of the main reasons why trading in futures is so popular. Remember the ‘futures’ is a derivative instrument that just mimics the movement of its respective underlying. So if the underlying value is going down, so would the futures. This means if you are bearish about a stock then you can initiate a short position on its futures and hold on to the position overnight.</p>\n<p>Similar to depositing a margin while initiating a long position, the short position also would require a margin deposit. The margins are similar for both the long and short positions and they do not really change.</p>\n<p>To help you understand the ‘Mark to Market’ (M2M) perspective when you short futures, let us take up the following example. Imagine you have shorted HCL Technologies Limited at Rs.1990/-. The lot size is 125. The table below shows the stock price movement over the next few days and the respective M2M –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Day</th>\n<th>Ref price for M2M</th>\n<th>Closing Price</th>\n<th>P&amp;L for the day</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01 – (Initiate short)</td>\n<td>1990</td>\n<td>1982</td>\n<td>125 x 8 = 1000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>1982</td>\n<td>1975</td>\n<td>125 x 7 + 875</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"color: red;\">\n<td>03</td>\n<td>1975</td>\n<td>1980</td>\n<td>125 x 5 = 625</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"color: red;\">\n<td>04</td>\n<td>1980</td>\n<td>1989</td>\n<td>125 x 9 = 1125</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>1989</td>\n<td>1970</td>\n<td>125 x 19 = 2375</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06 – (Square off)</td>\n<td>1970</td>\n<td>1965</td>\n<td>125 x 5 = 625</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The two lines marked in red highlights the fact that they are loss making days. To get the overall profitability of the trade we could just add up all the M2M values –</p>\n<p>+ 1000 + 875 <span style=\"color: red;\"> – 625 – 1125 </span> + 2375 + 625</p>\n<p><b>= Rs.3125/-</b></p>\n<p>Alternatively we could look at it as –</p>\n<p>(Selling Price – Buying price) * Lot Size</p>\n<p>= (1990 – 1965) * 125</p>\n<p>= 25*125</p>\n<p><b>=Rs.3125/-</b></p>\n<p>So, shorting futures is very similar to initiating a long futures position, except that when you short you profit only if the price declines. Besides this, the margin requirement and the M2M calculation remains the same.</p>\n<p>Shorting is a very integral part of active trading. I would suggest you get as comfortable with initiating a short trade as you would with a long trade.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><b>Key takeaways from this chapter</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Shorting requires us to sell first and buy later</li>\n<li>Short trade is profitable only when the closing price is lower than the entry price</li>\n<li>When the price goes higher than the price at which one has shorted, then there would be a loss</li>\n<li>The stoploss in a short trade is always higher than the price at which one has shorted</li>\n<li>One can only short on an intraday basis in the spot market</li>\n<li>The short positions cannot be carried overnight in the spot market</li>\n<li>The short position in the futures market can be carried forward overnight</li>\n<li>The margins requirement for both short and long trades are similar</li>\n<li>The M2M computation is also similar for both short and long trades</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

The ‘Nifty Futures’ is the most widely traded futures instrument, thus making it the most liquid contract in the Indian derivative markets. In fact you may be surprised to know that Nifty Futures is easily one of the top 10 index futures contracts traded in the world. Once you get comfortable with futures trading I would imagine, like many of us you too would be actively trading the Nifty Futures. For this reason, it would make sense to understand Nifty futures thoroughly. However before we proceed any further, I would request you to refresh your memory on the Index, we have discussed the same<a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-stock-markets-index/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> here</strong>.</a></p>\n<p>I assume you are comfortable with the basic understanding of the index; therefore I will proceed to discuss the Index Futures or the Nifty Futures.</p>\n<p>As we know the futures instrument is a derivative contract that derives its value from an underlying asset. In the context of Nifty futures, the underlying is the Index itself. Hence the Nifty Futures derives its value from the Nifty Index. This means if the value of Nifty Index goes up, then the value of Nifty futures also goes up. Likewise if the value of Nifty Index declines, so would the Index futures.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot of Nifty Futures Contract –</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot_802.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5244\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"484\" sizes=\"(max-width: 579px) 100vw, 579px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot_802.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot_802.png 579w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screenshot_802-300x251.png 300w\" width=\"579\"/></a></p>\n<p>Like any other futures contract, Nifty Futures is also available in three variants – current month, mid-month, and far month. I have highlighted the same in red for your reference. Further, I have highlighted the Nifty Futures price which at the time of taking this snapshot was Rs. 11,484.9 per unit of Nifty. The corresponding underlying value (index value in spot) was Rs. 11,470.70. Of course, there is a difference between the spot price and the futures price, which is due to the futures pricing formula. We will understand the concepts related to futures pricing in the next chapter.</p>\n<p>Further, if you notice the lot size here is 75. We know the contract value is –</p>\n<p>CV = Futures Price * Lot Size</p>\n<p>= 11484.90 * 75</p>\n<p><strong>= Rs.861,367/-</strong></p>\n<p>Here are the margin requirements for trading Nifty Futures; I’ve used Zerodha <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/margin-calculator/SPAN/\">Margin Calculator</a> to get the margin values –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Order Type</th>\n<th>Margin</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NRML</td>\n<td>Rs.68,810/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MIS</td>\n<td>Rs.24,083/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>BO &amp; CO</td>\n<td>Rs.12,902/-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These details should give you a basic overview of the Nifty Futures. One of the main features of Nifty Futures that makes it so popular is its liquidity. Let us now proceed to understand what liquidity is and how one would measure it.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M4-Ch9-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1618\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/M4-Ch9-title.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/M4-Ch9-title.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/M4-Ch9-title-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>9.2 – Impact Cost</h2>\n<p><b style=\"color:red;\">Updated 24th August 2021</b> – As per the NSE’s definition, Impact Cost is defined as the cost that a buyer or a seller needs to bear when executing a transaction in a given security. It is a measure to gauge the market liquidity and provides a much more accurate picture of the cost traders bear when executing a trade in comparison to the bid-ask spread. It is measured separately for the buy-side &amp; the sell-side and varies according to the size of the transaction. The Impact cost is dynamic in nature and keeps changing based on the order book. For stocks that are to be included in indices (like Nifty 50, Nifty 500), one of the criteria for eligibility is the impact cost being below a certain threshold (For more details about this, refer to the <a href=\"https://archives.nseindia.com/content/indices/Method_NIFTY_Equity_Indices.pdf\">Index Methodology document</a>).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.nseindia.com/products-services/indices-impact-cost\">formula</a> for calculating the impact cost is as follows –</p>\n<p>Ideal Price = (Best Buy Price in Orderbook + Best Sell Price in Orderbook) / 2</p>\n<p>Actual Buy Price = Sum of (Quantity * Execution Price) / Total Quantity</p>\n<p>Impact Cost (for that particular quantity) = (Actual Buy Price – Ideal Price) / Ideal Price * 100</p>\n<p>To explain this using an example, let us consider Infosys –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Infy_orderbook.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-10067\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"568\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Infy_orderbook.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Infy_orderbook.png 726w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Infy_orderbook-300x235.png 300w\" width=\"726\"/></a></p>\n<p>Let’s suppose a person wants to buy 350 quantities of Infosys. Now let us calculate the impact cost for this transaction –</p>\n<p>Ideal Price = (1657.95+1658)/2 = 1657.975 ~ 1657.98</p>\n<p>Actual Buy Price = (15*1658) + (335*1658.20) / 350 = 1658.19143 ~ 1658.19</p>\n<p>Impact Cost for buying 350 shares = ((1658.19 – 1657.98) / 1657.98) * 100 = 0.012%</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The few key messages that I want you to take away from this discussion are these –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Impact cost gives a sense of liquidity</li>\n<li>The higher the liquidity in a stock, the lesser is the impact cost</li>\n<li>The spread between the buying and selling price is also an indicator of liquidity\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Higher the spread, the higher the impact cost</li>\n<li>Lower the spread, the lower is the impact cost</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Higher the liquidity, lesser the volatility</li>\n<li>If the stock is not liquid, placing market orders is not a great idea</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>9.3 – Why trading Nifty makes sense</h2>\n<p>As you know the Nifty Index is a basket of 50 stocks. These stocks are selected to represent a wide section of the India economic sectors. This makes Nifty a good representative of the broader economic activity in India. This naturally means if the general economic activity is going up or at least expected to go up then Nifty’s value also goes up, and vice versa. This also makes trading Nifty Futures a much better choice as compared to single stock futures. There are many reasons for this, here are some –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>It is diversified</strong> – At times taking a directional call on a single stock can be a tough task, this is mainly from the risk perceptive. For example, let us just say I decide to buy Infosys Limited with a hope that the quarterly results would be good. In case the results don’t impress the markets, then obviously the stock would take a knock and so would my P&amp;L. Nifty futures, on the other hand, has a diversified portfolio of 50 stocks. As it is a portfolio of stocks, the movement of the Index does not really depend on a single stock. Of course, occasionally a few stocks (index heavyweights) can influence Nifty to some extent but not on an everyday basis. In other words when you trade Nifty futures you completely eliminate ‘unsystematic risk’ and deal with only with ‘systematic risk’. I know these are new jargons being introduced here, we will discuss these terms in more detail at a later stage when we talk about hedging.</li>\n<li><strong>Hard to manipulate –</strong> The movement in Nifty is a response to the collective movement in the top 50 companies in India (by market capitalization). Hence there is virtually no scope to manipulate the Nifty index. However the same cannot be said about individual stocks (remember Satyam, DHCL, Bhushan Steel etc)</li>\n<li><strong>Highly Liquid (easy fills, less slippage) </strong>– We discussed liquidity earlier in the chapter. Since the Nifty is so highly liquid you can literally transact any quantity of Nifty without worrying about losing money on the impact cost. Besides, there is so much liquidity that you can literally transact any number of contracts that you wish.</li>\n<li><strong>Lesser margins</strong> – Nifty futures require much lesser margins as compared to individual stock futures. To give you a perspective Nifty’s margin requirement varies between 12-15%, however individual stock margins can go as high as 45-60%.</li>\n<li><strong>Broader economic call – </strong>Trading the Nifty futures requires one to take a broad-based economic call rather than company specify directional calls. From my experience, doing the former is much easier than the latter.</li>\n<li><strong>Application of Technical Analysis – </strong>Technical Analysis works best on liquid instruments. Liquid stocks are hard to manipulate, hence they usually move based on the demand-supply dynamics of the market, which obviously is what a TA mainly relies on</li>\n<li><strong>Less volatile</strong> – Nifty futures are less volatile compared to individual stock futures. To give you perspective the Nifty futures has an annualized volatility of around 16-17%, whereas individual stocks like say Infosys has annualized volatility of upwards of 30%.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Nifty Futures derives its value based on the Nifty Index in spot, which is its underlying</li>\n<li>At present, the Nifty futures lot size is 75</li>\n<li>The Nifty futures is the most liquid futures contract in India</li>\n<li>Just like other future contracts, Nifty Futures contracts are also available with three different expiry options (Current month, Mid Month, and Far Month)</li>\n<li>A round trip trade is an arbitrary quick instantaneous trade which involves buying at the best available sell price and selling at the best available buy price</li>\n<li>A round trip trade always results in a loss</li>\n<li>Impact cost measures the loss of a round trip as a % of average of bid and ask</li>\n<li>Higher the impact cost, lesser the liquidity and vice versa</li>\n<li>When you place a market order to transact, you may lose some money owing to impact cost</li>\n<li>Nifty has an impact cost close to 0.0082%, which makes it the most liquid contract to trade</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

However we have deliberately opted to talk about it now, at a much later stage. The reason is simple – if you are trading futures based on technical analysis (I assume a vast majority of you are doing this) then you would not really need to know how the futures are priced, although a good working knowledge would help. However if you aspire to trade futures by employing quantitative strategies such as Calendar Spreads or Index Arbitrage then you certainly need to know this. In fact we will have a module dedicated to ‘Trading Strategies’ where we would discuss some of these strategies, hence the discussion in this chapter will lay down a foundation for the forthcoming modules.</p>\n<p>If you recall, in some of the earlier chapters occasionally we discussed the ‘Futures Pricing Formula’ as the prime reason for the difference between the spot price and the futures price. Well, I guess it is time now to lift the veil and introduce the ‘Future Pricing Formula’.</p>\n<p>We know the futures instrument derives its value from its respective underlying. We also know that the futures instrument moves in sync with its underlying. If the underlying price falls, so would the futures price and vice versa. However, the underlying price and the futures price differs and they are not really the same. To give you a perspective as I write this, Nifty Spot is at 8,845.5 whereas the corresponding current month contract is trading at 8,854.7, please refer to the snap shot below. This difference in price between the futures price and the spot price is called the <strong>“basis or spread”</strong>. In case of the Nifty example below, the spread is 9.2 points (8854.7 – 8845.5).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-1_Fut-Price.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image-1_Fut-Price\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1637\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"510\" sizes=\"(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-1_Fut-Price.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-1_Fut-Price.jpg 573w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-1_Fut-Price-300x267.jpg 300w\" width=\"573\"/></a></p>\n<p>The difference in price is attributable to the <strong>‘Spot – Future Parity’</strong>. The spot future parity the difference between the spot and futures price that arises due to variables such as interest rates, dividends, time to expiry etc. In a very loose sense it is simply is a mathematical expression to equate the underlying price and its corresponding futures price. This is also known as the <strong>futures pricing formula</strong>.</p>\n<p>The futures pricing formula simply states –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffa9ba;\">Futures Price = Spot price *(1+ r<sub>f</sub> )– d</strong></p>\n<p>Where,</p>\n<p>r<sub>f</sub> = Risk-free rate</p>\n<p>d – Dividend</p>\n<p>Note, ‘r<sub>f</sub>’ is the risk-free rate that you can earn for the entire year (365 days); considering the expiry is at 1, 2, and 3 months one may want to scale it proportionately for time periods other than the exact 365 days. Therefore a more generic formula would be –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffa9ba;\">Futures Price = Spot price * [1+ r<sub>f</sub>*(x/365)]– d</strong></p>\n<p>Where,</p>\n<p>x = number of days to expiry.</p>\n<p>One can take the RBI’s 91 day Treasury bill as a proxy for the short term risk-free rate. You can find the same on the RBI’s home page, as shown in the snapshot below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-2_RBI.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image-2_RBI\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1638\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"321\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-2_RBI.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-2_RBI.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-2_RBI-300x120.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>As we can see from the image above, the current rate is 8.3528%. Keeping this in perspective let us work on a pricing example. Assume Infosys spot is trading at 2,280.5 with 7 more days to expiry, what should Infosys’s current month futures contract be priced at?</p>\n<p><strong>Futures Price = 2280.5 * [1+8.3528 %( 7/365)] – 0</strong></p>\n<p>Do note, Infosys is not expected to pay any dividend over the next 7 days, hence I have assumed dividend as 0. Solving the above equation, the future price turns out to be 2283. This is called the <strong>‘Fair value’</strong> of futures. However the actual futures price as you can see from the image below is 2284. The actual price at which the futures contract trades is called the <strong>‘Market Price’. </strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-3_Infy.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image-3_Infy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1639\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"511\" sizes=\"(max-width: 579px) 100vw, 579px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-3_Infy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-3_Infy.jpg 579w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-3_Infy-300x265.jpg 300w\" width=\"579\"/></a></p>\n<p>The difference between the fair value and market price mainly occurs due to market costs such as transaction charges, taxes, margins etc. However by and large the fair value reflects where the futures should be trading at a given risk free rate and number of days to expiry. Let us take this further, and figure out the futures price for mid month and far month contracts.</p>\n<p><strong>Mid month calculation</strong></p>\n<p>Number of days to expiry = 34 (as the contract expires on 26<sup>th</sup> March 2015)</p>\n<p>Futures Price = 2280.5 * [1+8.3528 %( 34/365)] – 0</p>\n<p><strong>= 2299</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Far month calculation</strong></p>\n<p>Number of days to expiry = 80 (as the contract expires on 30<sup>th</sup> April 2015)</p>\n<p>Futures Price = 2280.5 * [1+8.3528 %( 80/365)] – 0</p>\n<p><strong>= 2322</strong></p>\n<p>From NSE website let us take a look at the actual market prices –</p>\n<p><em>Snapshot of Infosys’s mid month contract</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-4_Infy.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image-4_Infy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1640\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"220\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-4_Infy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-4_Infy.jpg 580w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-4_Infy-300x114.jpg 300w\" width=\"580\"/></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Snapshot of Infosys’s mid month contract</em></p>\n<p><img alt=\"Image-5_Infy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1641\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"192\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-5_Infy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-5_Infy.jpg 580w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-5_Infy-300x99.jpg 300w\" width=\"580\"/></p>\n<p>Clearly there is a difference between the calculated fair value and the market price. I would attribute this to the applicable costs. Besides, the market could be factoring in some financial yearend dividends as well. However the key point to note is as the number of days to expiry increases, the difference between the fair value and market value widens.</p>\n<p>In fact this leads us to another important commonly used market terminology – <strong>the discount and the premium. </strong></p>\n<p>If the futures is trading higher than the spot, which mathematically speaking is the natural order of things, then the futures market is said to be at ‘<strong>premium</strong>’. While ‘Premium’ is a term used in the Equity derivatives markets, the commodity derivatives market prefer to refer to the same phenomenon as ‘<strong>Contango</strong>’. However, both contango and premium refer to the same fact – The Futures are trading higher than the Spot.</p>\n<p>Here is a plot of Nifty spot and its corresponding futures for the January 2015 series. As you can see the Nifty futures is trading above the spot during the entire series.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-6_Spread.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image-6_Spread\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1642\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"393\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-6_Spread.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-6_Spread.jpg 576w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Image-6_Spread-300x205.jpg 300w\" width=\"576\"/></a></p>\n<p>I specifically want to draw your attention to the following few points –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At the start of the series (highlighted by a black arrow) the spread between the spot and futures is quite high. This is because the number of days to expiry is high hence the x/365 factor in the futures pricing formula is also high.</li>\n<li>The futures remained at premium to the spot throughout the series</li>\n<li>At the end of the series (highlighted by a blue arrow) the futures and the spot have converged. In fact this always happens. Irrespective of whether the future is at a premium or a discount, <strong>on the day of the expiry, the futures and spot will always converge</strong>.</li>\n<li>If you have a futures position and if you fail to square off the position by expiry, then the exchange will square off the position automatically and it will be settled at the spot price as both futures and spot converges on the day of the expiry</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Not always does the futures trade richer than the spot. There could be instances – mainly owing to short term demand and supply imbalances where the futures would trade cheaper than its corresponding spot. This situation is when the futures is said to be trading at a discount to the spot. In the commodities world, the same situation is referred to as the <strong>“backwardation”. </strong></p>\n<h2>10.2 – Practical Application</h2>\n<p>Before we conclude this chapter, let us put the futures pricing formula to some practical use. Like I had mentioned earlier, futures pricing formula comes very handy when you aspire to trade employing quantitative trading techniques. Please note, the following discussion is only a preview window into the world of trading strategies. We will discuss all these things plus more in greater detail when we take up the module on “Trading Strategies”. Consider this situation –</p>\n<p>Wipro Spot = 653</p>\n<p>R<sub>f – </sub>8.35%</p>\n<p>x = 30</p>\n<p>d = 0</p>\n<p>Given this, the futures should be trading at –</p>\n<p>Futures Price = 653*(1+8.35 %( 30/365)) – 0</p>\n<p>= 658</p>\n<p>Accommodate for market charges, the futures should be trading in and around 658. Now what if instead the futures contract is trading at a drastically different price? Let’s say 700? Clearly there is a trade here. The difference between the spot and futures should ideally be just 5 points, but due to market imbalances the difference has shot up to 47 points. This is a spread that we can capture by deploying a trade.</p>\n<p>Here is how one can do this – since the future contract is trading above its fair value, we term the futures market price as <strong>expensive relative to its fair value</strong>. Alternatively we can say, the spot is trading cheaper with respect to the futures.</p>\n<p>The thumb rule in any sort of ‘spread trade’ is to buy the cheaper asset and sell the expensive one. Hence going by this, we can sell Wipro Futures on one hand and simultaneously buy Wipro in the spot market. Let us plug in the numbers and see how this goes –</p>\n<p>Buy Wipro in Spot @ 653</p>\n<p>Sell Wipro in Futures @ 700</p>\n<p>Now we know that on the expiry day, both the spot and the futures converge into one single price (refer to the Nifty graph posted above). Let us assume a few random values at which the futures and the spot converge – 675, 645, 715 and identify what happens to the trade –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Expiry Value</th>\n<th>Spot Trade P&amp;L (Long)</th>\n<th>Futures Trade P&amp;L (Short)</th>\n<th>Net P&amp;L</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>675</td>\n<td>675 – 653 = +22</td>\n<td>700 – 675 = +25</td>\n<td>+22 + 25 = +47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>645</td>\n<td>645 – 653 = -08</td>\n<td>700 – 645 = +55</td>\n<td>-08 + 55 = +47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>715</td>\n<td>715 – 653 = +62</td>\n<td>700 – 715 = -15</td>\n<td>+62 – 15 = +47</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As you can notice, once you have executed the trade at the expected price you have essentially locked in the spread. So irrespective of where the market goes by expiry, the profits are guaranteed! Of course, it goes without saying that it makes sense to square off the positions just before the expiry of the futures contract. This would require you to sell Wipro in spot market and buy back Wipro in Futures market.</p>\n<p>This kind of trade between the futures and the spot to extract and profit from the spread is also called the ‘<strong>Cash &amp; Carry Arbitrage</strong>’.</p>\n<p><strong>10.3 – Calendar Spreads</strong></p>\n<p>The calendar spread is a simple extension of the cash &amp; carry arbitrage. In a calendar spread, we attempt to extract and profit from the spread created between two futures contracts of the same underlying but with different expiries. Let us continue with the Wipro example and understand this better –</p>\n<p>Wipro Spot is trading at = 653</p>\n<p>Current month futures fair value (30 days to expiry) = 658</p>\n<p>Actual market value of current month futures = 700</p>\n<p>Mid month futures fair value (65 days to expiry) = 663</p>\n<p>Actual market value of mid month futures = 665</p>\n<p>From the above example, clearly the current month futures contract is trading way above its expected theoretical fair value. However the mid month contract is trading close to its actual fair value estimate. With these observations, I will make an assumption that the current month contract’s basis will eventually narrow down and the mid month contract will continue to trade close to its fair value.</p>\n<p>Now with respect to the mid month contract, the current month contract appears to be expensive. Hence we sell the expensive contract and buy the relatively cheaper one. Therefore the trade set up would require me to buy the mid month futures contract @ 665 and sell the current month contract @ 700.</p>\n<p>What do you think is the spread here? Well, the spread is the difference between the two future contracts i.e 700 – 665 = 35 points.</p>\n<p>The trade set up to capture the spread goes like this –</p>\n<p>Sell the current month futures @ 700</p>\n<p>Buy the mid month futures @ 665</p>\n<p>Do note – because you are buying and selling the same underlying futures of different expiries, the margins are greatly reduced as this is a hedged position.</p>\n<p>Now after initiating the trade, one has to wait for the current month’s futures to expire.  Upon expiry, we know the current month futures and the spot will converge to a single price. Of course on a more practical note, it makes sense to unwind the trade just before the expiry.</p>\n<p>Let us arbitrarily take a few scenarios as below and see how the P&amp;L pans out –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Expiry Value</th>\n<th>Current month P&amp;L (Short)</th>\n<th>Mid Month P&amp;L (Long)</th>\n<th>Net P&amp;L</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>660</td>\n<td>700 – 660 = +40</td>\n<td>660 – 665 = -5</td>\n<td>+40 – 5 = +35</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>690</td>\n<td>700 – 690 = +10</td>\n<td>690 – 665 = +25</td>\n<td>+10 + 25 = +35</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>725</td>\n<td>700 – 725 = -25</td>\n<td>725 – 665 = +60</td>\n<td>-25 + 60 = +35</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Of course, do recall the critical assumption we have made here is that i.e. the mid month contract will stick close to its fair value. From my trading experience this happens most of the times.</p>\n<p>Most importantly please do bear in mind the discussion with respect to spreads in this chapter is just a sneak peek into the world of trading strategies. We will discuss these strategies in a separate module which would give you an in depth analysis on how one can professionally deploy these strategies.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The futures pricing formula states that the Futures Price = Spot price *(1+R<sub>f</sub> (x/365)) – d</li>\n<li>The difference between futures and spot is called the basis or simply the spread</li>\n<li>The futures price as estimated by the pricing formula is called the “Theoretical fair value”</li>\n<li>The price at which the futures trade in the market is called the ‘market value’</li>\n<li>The theoretical fair value of futures and market value by and large should be around the same value.

In the event of any adverse market movements, hedging is a simple work around to protect your trading positions from making a loss. Let me to attempt giving you an analogy to help you understand what hedging really is.</p>\n<p>Imagine you have a small bit of vacant barren land just outside your house, instead of seeing it lie vacant and barren you decide to lawn the entire plot and plant few nice flowering plants. You nurture the little garden, water it regularly, and watch it grow. Eventually your efforts are paid off and the lawn grows lush green and the flowers finally start to blossom. As the plants grow and flowers start to bloom it starts to attract attention of the wrong kind. Soon you realize your little garden has become a hot destination for a few stray cows. You notice these stray cows merrily gazing away the grass and spoiling the nice flowers. You are really annoyed with this and decide to protect your little garden? A simple work around is what you have in mind – you erect a fence (maybe a wooden hedge) around the garden to prevent the cows from entering your garden. This little work around ensures your garden stays protected and also lets your garden flourish.</p>\n<p>Let us now correlate this analogy to the markets –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine you nurture a portfolio by picking each stock after careful analysis. Slowly you invest a sizable corpus in your portfolio. This is equivalent to the garden you grow</li>\n<li>At some point after your money is invested in the markets you realize that the markets may soon enter a turbulent phase which would result in portfolio losses. This is equivalent to the stray cow grazing your lawn and spoiling your flower plants</li>\n<li>To prevent your market positions from losing money you construct a portfolio hedge by employing futures. This is equivalent to erecting a fence (wooden hedge) around your garden</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope the above analogy gave you got a fair sense of what ‘hedging’ is all about. Like I had mentioned earlier, hedging is a technique to ensure your position in the market is not affected by any adverse movements. Please don’t be under the impression that hedging is done only to protect a portfolio of stocks, in fact you can employ a hedge to protect individual stock positions, albeit with some restrictions.</p>\n<h2>11.2 – Hedge – But why?</h2>\n<p>A common question that gets asked frequently when one discusses about hedging is why really hedge a position? Imagine this – A trader or an investor has a stock which he has purchased at Rs.100. Now he feels the market is likely to decline and so would his stock. Given this, he can choose to do one of the following –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take no action and let his stock decline with a hope it will eventually bounce back</li>\n<li>Sell the stock and hope to buy it back later at a lower price</li>\n<li>Hedge the position</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Firstly let us understand what really happens when the trader decides not to hedge. Imagine the stock you invested declines from Rs.100 to let us say Rs.75. We will also assume eventually as time passes by the stock will bounce back to Rs.100. So the point here is when the stock eventually moves back to its original price, why should one really hedge?</p>\n<p>Well, you would agree the drop from Rs.100/- to Rs.75/- is a 25% drop. However when the stock has to move back from Rs.75/- to Rs.100/- it is no longer a scale back of 25% instead it works out to that the stock has to move by 33.33% to reach the original investment value! This means when the stock drops it takes less effort do to so, but it requires extra efforts to scale back to the original value. Also, from my experience I can tell you stocks do not really go up that easily unless it is a raging bull market. Hence for this reason, whenever one anticipates a reasonably massive adverse movement in the market, it is always prudent to hedge the positions.</p>\n<p>But what about the 2<sup>nd</sup> option ? Well, the 2<sup>nd</sup> option where the investor sells the position and buys back the same at a later stage requires one to time the market, which is not something easy to do. Besides when the trader transacts frequently, he will also not get the benefit of Long term capital tax. Needless to say, frequent transaction also incurs additional transactional fees.</p>\n<p>For all these reasons, hedging makes sense as he is virtually insulates the position in the market and is therefore becomes indifferent to what really happens in the market. It is like taking vaccine shot against a virus. Hence when the trader hedges he can be rest assured the adverse movement in the market will not affect his position.</p>\n<h2>11.3 – Risk</h2>\n<p>Before we proceed to understand how we could hedge our positions in the market, I guess it is important to understand what is that we are trying to hedge. Quite obviously as you can imagine, we are hedging the risk, but what kind of risk?</p>\n<p>When you buy the stock of a company you are essentially exposed to risk. In fact there are two types of risk – <strong>Systematic Risk and Unsystematic Risk</strong>. When you buy a stock or a stock future, you are automatically exposed to both these risks.</p>\n<p>The stock can decline (resulting in losses for you) for many reasons. Reasons such as –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Declining revenue</li>\n<li>Declining profit margins</li>\n<li>Higher financing cost</li>\n<li>High leverage</li>\n<li>Management misconduct</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All these reasons represent a form of risk, in fact there could be many other similar reasons and this list can go on. However if you notice, there is one thing common to all these risks – they are all <strong>company specific risk</strong>. For example imagine you have an investable capital of Rs.100,000/-. You decide to invest this money in HCL Technologies Limited. Few months later HCL makes a statement that their revenues have declined. Quite obviously HCL stock price will decline. Which means you will lose money on your investment. However this news will not impact HCL’s competitor’s (Tech Mahindra or Mindtree) stock price. Likewise if the management is guilty of any misconduct, then Tech Mahindra’s stock price will go down and not its competitors. Clearly these risks which are specific to the company affect only the company in question and not others. Such risks are often called the “<strong>Unsystematic Risk</strong>”.</p>\n<p>Unsystematic risk can be diversified, meaning instead of investing all the money in one company, you can choose to diversify and invest in 2-3 different companies (preferably from different sectors). When you do so, unsystematic risk is drastically reduced. Going back to the above example imagine instead of buying HCL for the entire capital, you decide to buy HCL for Rs.50,000/- and maybe Karnataka Bank Limited for the other Rs.50,000/-. Under such a circumstance, even if HCL stock price declines (owing to the unsystematic risk) the damage is only on half of the investment as the other half is invested in a different company. In fact instead of just two stocks you can have a 5 stock or 10 or maybe 20 stock portfolio. The higher the number of stocks in your portfolio, higher the diversification and therefore lesser the unsystematic risk.</p>\n<p>This leads us to a very important question – how many stocks should a good portfolio have so that the unsystematic risk is completely diversified. Research has it that up to 21 stocks in the portfolio will have the required necessary diversification effect and anything beyond 21 stocks may not help much in diversification.</p>\n<p>The graph below should give you a fair sense of how diversification works –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/graph-m4-ch11.png\"><img alt=\"graph-m4-ch11\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2770\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"500\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/graph-m4-ch11.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/graph-m4-ch11.png 700w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/graph-m4-ch11-300x214.png 300w\" width=\"700\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can notice from the graph above, the unsystematic risk drastically reduces when you diversify and add more stocks. However after about 20 stocks the unsystematic risk is not really diversifiable, this is evident as the graph starts to flatten out after 20 stocks.  In fact the risk that remains even after diversification is called the “<strong>Systematic Risk</strong>”.</p>\n<p>Systematic risk is the risk that is common to all stocks. These are usually the macroeconomic risks which tend to affect the whole market. Example of systematic risk include –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>De-growth in GDP</li>\n<li>Interest rate tightening</li>\n<li>Inflation</li>\n<li>Fiscal deficit</li>\n<li>Geo political risk</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course the list can go on but I suppose you got a fair idea of what constitutes systematic risk. Systematic risk affects all stocks. So assuming you have a well diversified 20 stocks portfolio, a de-growth in GDP will certainly affect all 20 stocks and hence they are all likely to decline. Systematic risk is <strong>inherent in the system</strong> and it cannot really be diversified. However systematic risk can be ‘<strong>hedged</strong>’. So when we are talking about hedging, do bear in mind that it is not the same as diversification.</p>\n<p>Remember, we diversify to minimize unsystematic risk and we hedge to minimize systematic risk.</p>\n<h2>11.4 – Hedging a single stock position</h2>\n<p>We will first talk about hedging a single stock future as it is relatively simple and straight forward to implement. We will also understand its limitation and then proceed to understand how to hedge a portfolio of stocks.</p>\n<p>Imagine you have bought 250 shares of Infosys at Rs.2,284/- per share. This works out to an investment of Rs.571,000/-. Clearly you are ‘<strong>Long</strong>’ on Infosys in the spot market. After you initiated this position, you realize the quarterly results are expected soon. You are worried Infosys may announce a not so favorable set of numbers, as a result of which the stock price may decline considerably. To avoid making a loss in the spot market you decide to hedge the position.</p>\n<p>In order to hedge the position in spot, we simply have to enter a counter position in the futures market. Since the position in the spot is ‘<strong>long</strong>’, we have to ‘<strong>short</strong>’ in the futures market.</p>\n<p>Here are the short futures trade details –</p>\n<p>Short Futures @ 2285/-</p>\n<p>Lot size = 250</p>\n<p>Contract Value = Rs.571,250/-</p>\n<p>Now on one hand you are long on Infosys (in spot market) and on the other hand we are short on Infosys (in futures price), although at different prices. However the variation in price is not of concern as directionally we are ‘<strong>neutral</strong>’. You will shortly understand what this means.</p>\n<p>After initiating this trade, let us arbitrarily imagine different price points for Infosys and see what will be the overall impact on the positions.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Arbitrary Price</th>\n<th>Long Spot P&amp;L</th>\n<th>Short Futures P&amp;L</th>\n<th>Net P&amp;L</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2200</td>\n<td>2200 – 2284 = – 84</td>\n<td>2285 – 2200 = +85</td>\n<td>-84 + 85 = +1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2290</td>\n<td>2290 – 2284 = +6</td>\n<td>2285 – 2290 = -5</td>\n<td>+6 – 5 = +1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2500</td>\n<td>2500 – 2284 = +216</td>\n<td>2285 – 2500 = -215</td>\n<td>+216 – 215 = +1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The point to note here is – irrespective of where the price is headed (whether it increases or decreases) the position will neither make money nor lose money. It is as if the overall position is frozen. In fact the position becomes indifferent to the market, which is why we say when a position is hedged it stays ‘neutral’ to the overall market condition. As I had mentioned earlier, hedging single stock positions is very straight forward with no complications. We can use the stock’s futures contract to hedge the position. But to use the stocks futures position one must have the same number of shares as that of the lot size. If they vary, the P&amp;L will vary and position will no longer be perfectly hedged. This leads to a few important questions –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What if I have a position in a stock that does not have a futures contract? For example South Indian Bank does not have a futures contract, does that mean I cannot hedge a spot position in South Indian Bank?</li>\n<li>The example considered the spot position value was Rs.570,000/-, but what if I have relatively small positions – say Rs.50,000/- or Rs.100,000/- is it possible to hedge such positions?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In fact the answer to both these questions is not really straight forward. We will understand how and why shortly. For now we will proceed to understand how we can hedge multiple spot positions (usually a portfolio). In order to do so, we first need to understand something called as “<strong>Beta</strong>” of a stock.<br/>\n<span id=\"beta\"> </span></p>\n<h2>11.5 – Understanding Beta (β)</h2>\n<p>Beta, denoted by the Greek symbol β, plays a very crucial concept in market finance as it finds its application in multiple aspects of market finance. I guess we are at a good stage to introduce beta, as it also finds its application in hedging portfolio of stocks.</p>\n<p>In plain words Beta measures the sensitivity of the stock price with respect to the changes in the market, which means it helps us answer these kinds of questions –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If market moves up by 2% tomorrow, what is the likely movement in stock XYZ?</li>\n<li>How risky (or volatile)is stock XYZ compared to market indices (Nifty, Sensex)?</li>\n<li>How risky is stock XYZ compared to stock ABC?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The beta of a stock can take any value greater or lower than zero. However, the beta of the  market indices (Sensex and Nifty) is always +1. Now for example assume beta of BPCL is +0.7, the following things are implied –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For every +1.0% increase in market, BPCL is expected to move up by 0.7%\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>If market moves up by 1.5%, BPCL is expected to move up by 1.05%</li>\n<li>If market decreases by 1.0%, BPCL is expected to decline by 0.7%</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Because BPCL’s beta is less than the market beta (0.7% versus 1.0%) by 0.3%, it is believed that BPCL is 30% less risky than markets\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>One can even say, BPCL relatively carries less systematic risk</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Assuming HPCL’s beta is 0.85%, then BPCL is believed to be less volatile compared HPCL, therefore less risky</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following table should help you get a perspective on how to interpret beta value for stock –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>If Beta of a stock is</th>\n<th>Interpretation</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Less than 0, Ex : -0.4</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">A -ve sign indicates the stock price and markets move in the<br/>\nopposite direction. If market moves up by 1%, then –ve beta stock<br/>\nof -0.4 is expected to decline by 0.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Equal to 0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">It means the stock is independent of the market movement.<br/>\nThe variation in the market is not likely to affect the movement in the<br/>\nstock. However, stocks with 0 beta is hard to find</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Higher than 0 lesser than 1,<br/>\nEx : 0.6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">It means the stock and the market move in the same direction;<br/>\nhowever the stock is relatively less risky. A move of 1% in the market<br/>\ninfluences the stock to move up by 0.6%. These are generally called the low beta stocks.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">Higher than 1, Ex : 1.2</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\">It means the stock moves in the same direction as the markets;<br/>\nhowever the stock tends to move 20% more than the market.<br/>\nMeaning, if the market increases by 1.0%, the stock is expected<br/>\nto go up by 1.2%. Likewise if the market declines by 1% the stock<br/>\nis expected to decline by 1.2%.

However before we proceed with this, you may have this question – why should we use Nifty Futures to hedge a portfolio? Why not something else?</p>\n<p>Do recall there are 2 types of risk – systematic and unsystematic risk. When we have a diversified portfolio we are naturally minimizing the unsystematic risk. What is left after this is the systematic risk. As we know systematic risk is the risk associated with the markets, hence the best way to insulate against market risk is by employing an index which represents the market. Hence the Nifty futures come as a natural choice to hedge the systematic risk.</p>\n<p>Assume I have Rs.800,000/- invested across the following stocks –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Stock Name</th>\n<th>Stock Beta</th>\n<th>Investment Amount</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>ACC Limited</td>\n<td>1.22</td>\n<td>Rs.30,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>Axis Bank Limited</td>\n<td>1.40</td>\n<td>Rs.125,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>BPCL</td>\n<td>1.42</td>\n<td>Rs.180,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>Cipla</td>\n<td>0.59</td>\n<td>Rs.65,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>DLF</td>\n<td>1.86</td>\n<td>Rs.100,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td>Infosys</td>\n<td>0.43</td>\n<td>Rs.75,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td>LT</td>\n<td>1.43</td>\n<td>Rs.85,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td>Maruti Suzuki</td>\n<td>0.95</td>\n<td>Rs.140,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\">Total</td>\n<td>Rs.800,000/-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Step 1 – Portfolio Beta</strong></p>\n<p>There are a few steps involved in hedging a stock portfolio.

For the portfolio above the beta happens to be 1.223. This means, if Nifty goes up by 1%, the portfolio as a whole is expected to go up by 1.223%. Likewise if Nifty goes down, the portfolio is expected to go down by 1.223%.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2 – Calculate the hedge value</strong></p>\n<p>Hedge value is simply the product of the Portfolio Beta and the total portfolio investment</p>\n<p>= 1.223 * 800,000</p>\n<p>= <strong>978,400/-</strong></p>\n<p>Remember this is a long only portfolio, where we have purchased these stocks in the spot market. We know in order to hedge we need to take a counter position in the futures markets. The hedge value suggests, to hedge a portfolio of Rs.800,000/- we need to short futures worth Rs.978,400/-. This should be quite intuitive as the portfolio is a ‘high beta portfolio’.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3 – Calculate the number of lots required</strong></p>\n<p>At present Nifty futures is trading at 9025, and with the current lot size of 25, the contract value per lot works out to –</p>\n<p>= 9025 * 25</p>\n<p>= Rs.225,625/-</p>\n<p>Hence the number of lots required to short Nifty Futures would be</p>\n<p>= Hedge Value / Contract Value</p>\n<p>= 978,400 / 225625</p>\n<p>= <strong>4.33</strong></p>\n<p>The calculation above suggests that, in order to perfectly hedge a portfolio of Rs.800,000/- with a beta of 1.223, one needs to short 4.33 lots of Nifty futures. Clearly we cannot short 4.33 lots as we can short either 4 or 5 lots, fractional lot sizes are not available.</p>\n<p>If we choose to short 4 lots, we would be slightly <strong>under hedged</strong>. Likewise if we short 5 units we would be <strong>over hedged</strong>. In fact for this reason, we cannot always perfectly hedge a portfolio.</p>\n<p>Now, let as assume after employing the hedge, Nifty in fact goes down by 500 points (or about 5.5%). With this we will calculate the effectiveness of the portfolio hedge. Just for the purpose of illustration, I will assume we can short 4.33 lots.</p>\n<p><strong>Nifty Position</strong></p>\n<p>Short initiated at – 9025</p>\n<p>Decline in Value – 500 points</p>\n<p>Nifty value – 8525</p>\n<p>Number of lots – 4.33</p>\n<p>P &amp; L = 4.33 * 25 * 500 = <strong>Rs.54,125</strong></p>\n<p>The short position has gained Rs.54,125/-. We will look into what could have happened on the portfolio.</p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio Position</strong></p>\n<p>Portfolio Value = Rs.800,000/-</p>\n<p>Portfolio Beta = 1.223</p>\n<p>Decline in Market = 5.5%</p>\n<p>Expected Decline in Portfolio = 5.5% * 1.233 = 6.78%</p>\n<p>= 6.78% * 800000</p>\n<p>= <strong>Rs. 54,240</strong></p>\n<p>Hence as you can see, one hand the Nifty short position has gained Rs.54,125 and on the other hand the long portfolio has lost Rs.54,240/-. As a net result, there is no loss or gain (please ignore the minor difference) in the net position in the market. The loss in portfolio is offset by the gain in the Nifty futures position.</p>\n<p>With this, I hope you are now in a position to understand how you could hedge a portfolio of stocks. I would encourage you to replace 4.33 lots by either 4 or 5 lots and run the same exercise.</p>\n<p>Finally before we wrap up this chapter, let us revisit two unanswered questions that we posted when we discussed hedging single stock positions. I will repost the same here for your convenience –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What if I have a position in a stock that does not have a futures contract? For example South Indian Bank does not have a futures contract, does that mean I cannot hedge a spot position in South Indian Bank?</li>\n<li>The example considered, the spot position value was Rs.570,000/-, but what if I have relatively small positions – say Rs.50,000/- or Rs.100,000/- is it possible to hedge such positions?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Well, you can hedge stocks that do not have stock futures. For example assume you have Rs.500,000/- worth of South Indian Bank. All you need to do is multiply the stocks beta with the investment value to identify the hedge value. Assuming the stock has a beta of 0.75, the hedge value would be</p>\n<p>500000*0.75</p>\n<p>= 375,000/-</p>\n<p>Once you arrive at this, directly divide the hedge value by the Nifty’s contract value to estimate the number of lots required (to short) in the futures market, and hence with this you can hedge the spot position safely.</p>\n<p>As far as the 2<sup>nd</sup> question goes – no, you cannot hedge small positions whose value is relatively lower than the contract value of Nifty. However you can hedge such positions by employing options. We will discuss the same when we take up options.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li>Hedging allows you to insulate your market position against any adverse movements in the market</li>\n<li>When you hedge your loss in the spot market it is offset by gains in the futures market</li>\n<li>There are two types of risk – systematic and unsystematic risk</li>\n<li>Systematic risk is risk specific to macroeconomic events.

After reading this, you will be able to interpret OI data in conjunction with the Volumes to make better decisions while trading. Also, I would suggest you refresh your understanding on Volumes from<a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/volumes/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> here.</strong></a><strong><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1.jpg\"><br/>\n</a></strong></p>\n<p>Open Interest (OI) is a number that tells you how many futures (or Options) contracts are currently outstanding (open) in the market.  Remember that there are always 2 sides to a trade – a buyer and a seller. Let us say the seller sells 1 contract to the buyer. The buyer is said to be long on the contract and the seller is said to be short on the <strong>same contract</strong>.  The open interest in this case is said to be 1.</p>\n<p>Let me illustrate OI with an example. Assume the market consists of 5 traders who trade NIFTY futures. We will name them Arjun, Neha, Varun, John, and Vikram. Let us go through their day to day trading activity and observe how open interest varies. Please note, you need to exercise some patience while understanding the flow of events below, else you can quite easily get frustrated!</p>\n<p>Lets get started.</p>\n<p><strong>Monday:</strong> Arjun buys 6 futures contracts and Varun buys 4 futures contracts, while Neha sells all of those 10 contracts. After this transaction, there are 10 contracts in total with 10 on the long side (6 + 4) and another 10 on the short side; hence the open interest is 10.  This is summarized in the table below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image 1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1685\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"316\" sizes=\"(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1.jpg 349w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1-300x272.jpg 300w\" width=\"349\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> Neha wants to get rid of 8 contracts out of the 10 contracts she holds, which she does. John comes into the market and takes on the 8 shorts contracts from her. You must realize that <strong>this transaction did not create any new contracts</strong> in the market. It was a simple transfer from one person to another. Hence the OI will still stand at 10.  Tuesday’s transaction is summarized in the table below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-2.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image 2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1686\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"316\" sizes=\"(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-2.jpg 565w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-2-300x168.jpg 300w\" width=\"565\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Wednesday:</strong> To the existing 8 short contracts, John wants to add 7 more short positions, while at the same time both Arjun and Varun decide to increase their long position. Hence John sold 3 contracts to Arjun and 2 contracts to Varun. Note, these are 5 new contracts created. Neha decides to close out her open positions. By going long on 2 contracts, she effectively transferred 2 of her short contracts to John and hence Neha holds no more contracts.  The table now looks like this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-3.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image 3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1687\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"316\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-3.jpg 780w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-3-300x122.jpg 300w\" width=\"780\"/></a></p>\n<p>By the end of Wednesday, there are 15 long (9+6) and 15 short positions in the market, hence OI stands at 15!</p>\n<p><strong>Thursday:</strong> A big guy named Vikram comes to the market and sells 25 contracts. John decides to liquidate 10 contracts, and hence buys 10 contracts from Vikram, effectively transferring his 10 contracts to Vikram. Arjun adds 10 more contracts from Vikram and finally Varun decides to buy the remaining 5 contracts from Vikram. In summary, <strong>15 new contracts got added </strong>to the system.  OI would now stands at 30.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-4.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image 4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1688\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"254\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-4.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-4-300x95.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Friday:</strong> Vikram decides to square off 20 of the 25 contracts he had sold previously.  So he buys 10 contracts each from Arjun and Varun. This means, 20 contracts in system got squared off, hence OI reduces by 20 contracts. The new OI is 30-20 = 10.  The final summary is listed in the table below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-5.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image 5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1689\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"209\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-5.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-5-300x78.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>So on and so forth; I hope the above discussion is giving you a fair sense of what Open Interest (OI) is all about. The OI information just indicates how many open positions are there in the market. Here is something you should have noticed by now. In the ‘contracts held’ column, if you assign a +ve sign to a long position and a –ve sign to a short position and add up the long and short positions, it always equates to zero.  In other words, wealth is transferred from buyers and sellers (or vice versa) and no new wealth is created (like if you hold a stock and stock price appreciates, then everyone makes money). For this reason, derivatives are often termed as a <strong>zero-sum game!</strong></p>\n<p>Have a look at the following snapshot –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-6.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image 6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1690\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"500\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-6.jpg 574w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-6-300x261.jpg 300w\" width=\"574\"/></a></p>\n<p>As of 4<sup>th</sup> March 2015, OI on Nifty futures is roughly 2.78 Crores. It means that there are 2.78 crore Long Nifty positions and 2.78 crore Short Nifty positions. Also, about 55,255 (or 0.2% over 2.78Crs) new contracts have been added today. OI is very useful in understanding how liquid the market is. Bigger the open interest, more liquid the market is. And hence it will be easier to enter or exit trades at competitive bid / ask rates.</p>\n<h2>12.2 – OI and Volume interpretation</h2>\n<p>Open interest information tells us how many contracts are open and live in the market. Volume on the other hand tells us how many trades were executed on the given day. For every 1 buy and 1 sell, volume adds up to 1. For instance, on a given day, 400 contracts were bought and 400 were sold, then the volume for the day is 400 and not 800. Clearly volumes and open interest are two different; buy seemingly similar set of information. The volume counter starts from zero at the start of the day and increments as and when new trades occur. Hence the volume data always increases on an intra-day basis. However, OI is not discrete like volumes, OI stacks up or reduces based on the entry and exit of traders. In fact for the example we have  just discussed, let us summarize the OI and volume information.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-7.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image 7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1691\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"343\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-7.jpg 442w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-7-300x233.jpg 300w\" width=\"442\"/></a></p>\n<p>Notice how OI and volume change on a daily basis. Today’s volume has no implication on tomorrow’s volume. However, it is not true for OI. From a stand-alone perspective both OI and volume numbers are pretty useless. However traders generally associate these numbers with prices to draw an inference about the market.</p>\n<p>The following tables summarizes the trader’s perspective with respect to changes in volume and prices –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Price</th>\n<th>Volume</th>\n<th>Trader’s Perception</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Increase</td>\n<td>Increase</td>\n<td>Bullish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decrease</td>\n<td>Decrease</td>\n<td>Bearish trend could probably end, expect reversal</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decrease</td>\n<td>Increase</td>\n<td>Bearish</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Increase</td>\n<td>Decrease</td>\n<td>Bullish trend could probably end, expect reversal</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Unlike volumes, the change in Open interest does not really convey any directional view on markets. However it does give a sense of strength between bullish and bearish positions. The following tables summarizes the trader’s perspective with respect to changes in the OI and prices –</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Price</th>\n<th>OI</th>\n<th>Trader’s Perception</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Increase</td>\n<td>Increase</td>\n<td>More trades on the long side</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decrease</td>\n<td>Decrease</td>\n<td>Longs are covering their position, also called long unwinding</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Decrease</td>\n<td>Increase</td>\n<td>More trades on the short side</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Increase</td>\n<td>Decrease</td>\n<td>Shorts are covering their position, also called short covering</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Do note, if there is an abnormally high OI backed by a rapid increase or decrease in prices then be cautious. This situation simply means that there is a lot of euphoria and leverage being built up in the market. In situations like this, even a small trigger could lead to a lot of panic in the market.</p>\n<p>And with this, I would like to conclude this module on Futures Trading.

    "lesson": "13. Quick Note on Physical Settlement",
    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2><b>13.1 – Overview</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until recent times, trading in equity futures and options was cash settled in India. What this means is that upon expiry of the contract, buyers or sellers had to settle their position in cash without having to take delivery of the underlying security. On April 11, 2018, SEBI released a circular making physical delivery of stocks for all stock F&amp;O contracts mandatory in a phased manner. The aim was to curb excessive speculation which would result in too much volatility in individual stocks.</span></p>\n<h2><b>13.2 What is Physical Settlement? </b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It means all stock F&amp;O contracts at expiry, are required to be given/taken delivery of the underlying security. From October 2019’s expiry, all stock F&amp;O contracts are compulsorily settled physically. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s understand this with an example, before the introduction of physical settlement, if you bought only a lot of SBI futures expiring this month, on expiry, the contract will be cash-settled based on the settlement price and you will receive the credit or debit in your trading account. We’ve explained how marked to market settlement works in this </span><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/margin-m2m/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chapter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But with the physical settlement, if you don’t close or rollover your position till expiry, you are required to pay the total contract and you will receive the delivery of shares to your Demat account.</span></p>\n<h2><b>13.3 Why is Physical Settlement enforced?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the contract is cash-settled, traders only are required to maintain the margin(SPAN +Exposure) for the contract and can lead to short-sellers building up excessive short positions closer to expiry artificially bringing down the price. With the physical settlement, these traders will have to buy the stock from the equity market or borrow on the SLB markets to be able to deliver the stocks to the counterparty. This brings in balance to the price not allowing for price manipulation.</span></p>\n<h2><b>13.4 How are positions settled?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On expiry, various F&amp;O contracts are settled in the following manner</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Delivery(stocks are delivered to your Demat account)- Long Futures, long ITM Call and short ITM Put</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give Delivery(you are required to deliver the stocks to the exchange)- Short Futures, short ITM Call and long ITM Put. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only ITM options will be physically settled, if the option expires OTM, they expire worthlessly and there won’t be any delivery obligation. </span></p>\n<h2><b>13.5 Netted off positions(subcategory)</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have multiple positions of the same underlying for the same expiration date and they form a hedge, depending on the direction of the trade, they will be netted off.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>1st Leg</b></td>\n<td><b>2nd Leg</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Long Futures</b></td>\n<td><b>Short ITM Call</b>\n<p><b>Long ITM Put</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Short Futures</b></td>\n<td><b>Long ITM Call</b>\n<p><b>Short ITM Put</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Long ITM Call</b></td>\n<td><b>Long ITM Put</b>\n<p><b>Short ITM Call</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Long ITM Put</b></td>\n<td><b>Long ITM Call</b>\n<p><b>Short ITM Put</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Short ITM Call</b></td>\n<td><b>Long ITM Call</b>\n<p><b>Short ITM Put</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Short ITM Put</b></td>\n<td><b>Short ITM Call</b>\n<p><b>Long ITM Put</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you have an SBI June long futures contract and long ITM Put of strike 200(SBI spot price at Rs 180), the long futures position will lead to a take delivery obligation and the long put option to a given delivery obligation. This will be netted off for your account and there won’t be any physical delivery obligation.</span></p>\n<h2><b>13.6 Margins</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are trading in the F&amp;O segment, for futures and short options, you will require to maintain only the margin amount in your account, for long options, just the premium required to buy. However, this changes with the physical settlement mechanism, where you are required to bring in 100% of the contract value to take delivery of the contract or bring in stocks to give delivery(depending on the direction of your trade). Brokers introduce additional margins when such positions get closer to expiry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can read on Zerodha’s physical settlement policy </span><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/z-connect/queries/policy-on-settlement-of-compulsory-delivery-derivative-contracts-update-oct-2019\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

For this reason we will start from scratch and slowly ramp up as we proceed. Let us start with running through some basic background information.</p>\n<p>The options market makes up for a significant part of the derivative market, particularly in India. I would not be exaggerating if I were to say that nearly 80% of the derivatives traded are options and the rest is attributable to the futures market. Internationally, the option market has been around for a while now, here is a quick background on the same –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Custom options were available as Over the Counter (OTC) since the 1920’s. These options were mainly on commodities</li>\n<li>Options on equities began trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1972</li>\n<li>Options on currencies and bonds began in late 1970s. These were again OTC trades</li>\n<li>Exchange-traded options on currencies began on Philadelphia Stock Exchange in 1982</li>\n<li>Interest rate options began trading on the CME in 1985</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clearly the international markets have evolved a great deal since the OTC days. However in India from the time of inception, the options market was facilitated by the exchanges. However options were available in the off market ‘Badla’ system. Think of the ‘badla system’ as a grey market for derivatives transactions. The badla system no longer exists, it has become obsolete. Here is a quick recap of the history of the Indian derivative markets –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>June 12th 2000 – Index futures were launched</li>\n<li>June 4th 2001 –Index options were launched</li>\n<li>July 2nd 2001 – Stock options were launched</li>\n<li>November 9th 2001 – Single stock futures were launched.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Though the options market has been around since 2001, the real liquidity in the Indian index options was seen only in 2006! I remember trading options around that time, the spreads were high and getting fills was a big deal. However in 2006, the Ambani brothers formally split up and their respective companies were listed as separate entities, thereby unlocking the value to the shareholders. In my opinion this particular corporate event triggered vibrancy in the Indian markets, creating some serious liquidity. However if you were to compare the liquidity in Indian stock options with the international markets, we still have a long way to catch up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch1-title1.jpg\"><img alt=\"M5-Ch1-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1716\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch1-title1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch1-title1.jpg 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch1-title1-300x150.jpg 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<h2>1.2 – A Special Agreement</h2>\n<p>There are two types of options – The Call option and the Put option. You can be a buyer or seller of these options. Based on what you choose to do, the P&amp;L profile changes. Of course we will get into the P&amp;L profile at a much later stage. For now, let us understand what “The Call Option” means. In fact the best way to understand the call option is to first deal with a tangible real world example, once we understand this example we will extrapolate the same to stock markets. So let’s get started.</p>\n<p>Consider this situation; there are two good friends, Ajay and Venu. Ajay is actively evaluating an opportunity to buy 1 acre of land that Venu owns. The land is valued at Rs.500,000/-. Ajay has been informed that in the next 6 months, a new highway project is likely to be sanctioned near the land that Venu owns. If the highway indeed comes up, the valuation of the land is bound to increase and therefore Ajay would benefit from the investment he would make today. However if the ‘highway news’ turns out to be a rumor- which means Ajay buys the land from Venu today and there is no highway  tomorrow, then Ajay would be stuck with a useless piece of land!</p>\n<p>So what should Ajay do? Clearly this situation has put Ajay in a dilemma as he is uncertain whether to buy the land from Venu or not. While Ajay is muddled in this thought, Venu is quite clear about selling the land if Ajay is willing to buy.</p>\n<p>Ajay wants to play it safe, he thinks through the whole situation and finally proposes a special structured arrangement to Venu, which Ajay believes is a win-win for both of them, the details of the arrangement is as follows –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ajay pays an upfront fee of Rs.100,000/- today. Consider this as a non refundable agreement fees that Ajay pays</li>\n<li>Against this fees, Venu agrees to sell the land after 6 months to Ajay</li>\n<li>The price of the sale( which is expected 6 months later) is fixed today at Rs.500,000/-</li>\n<li>Because Ajay has paid an upfront fee, only he can call off the deal at the end of 6 months (if he wants to that is), Venu cannot</li>\n<li>In the event Ajay calls off the deal at the end of 6 months, Venu gets to keep the upfront fees</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So what do you think about this special agreement? Who do you think is smarter here – Is it Ajay for proposing such a tricky agreement or Venu for accepting such an agreement? Well, the answer to these questions is not easy to answer, unless you analyze the details of the agreement thoroughly. I would suggest you read through the example carefully (it also forms the basis to understand options) – Ajay has plotted an extremely clever deal here! In fact this deal has many faces to it.</p>\n<p>Let us break down Ajay’s proposal to understand some details –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By paying an agreement fee of Rs.100,000/-, Ajay is binding Venu into an obligation. He is forcing Venu to lock the land for him for the next 6 months</li>\n<li>Ajay is fixing the sale price of the land based on today’s price i.e Rs.500,000/- which means irrespective of what the price would be 6 months later he gets to buy the land at today’s price. Do note, he is fixing a price and paying an additional Rs.100,000/- today</li>\n<li>At the end of the 6 months, if Ajay does not want to buy the land he has the right to say ‘no’ to Venu, but since Venu has taken the agreement fee from Ajay, Venu will not be in a position to say no to Ajay</li>\n<li>The agreement fee is non negotiable, non refundable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, after initiating this agreement both Ajay and Venu have to wait for the next 6 months to figure out what would actually happen. Clearly, the price of the land will vary based on the outcome of the ‘highway project’. However irrespective of what happens to the highway, there are only three possible outcomes –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Once the highway project comes up, the price of the land would go up, say it shoots up to Rs.10,00,000/-</li>\n<li>The highway project does not come up, people are disappointed, the land price collapses, say to Rs.300,000/-</li>\n<li>Nothing happens, price stays flat at Rs.500,000/-</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’m certain there could be no other possible outcomes that can occur apart from the three mentioned above.</p>\n<p>We will now step into Ajay’s shoes and think through what he would do in each of the above situations.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Price goes up to Rs.10,00,000/-</strong></p>\n<p>Since the highway project has come up as per Ajay’s expectation, the land price has also increased. Remember as per the agreement, Ajay has the right to call off the deal at the end of 6 months. Now, with the increase in the land price, do you think Ajay will call off the deal? Not really, because the dynamics of the sale are in Ajay’s favor –</p>\n<p>Current Market price of the land = Rs.10,00,000/-</p>\n<p>Sale agreement value = Rs.500,000/-</p>\n<p>This means Ajay now enjoys the right to buy a piece of land at Rs.500,000/- when in the open market the same land is selling at a much higher value of – Rs.10,00,000/-. Clearly Ajay is making a steal deal here. Hence he would go ahead and demand Venu to  sell him the land. Venu is obligated to sell him the land at a lesser value, simply because he had accepted Rs.100,000/- agreement fees from Ajay 6 months earlier.</p>\n<p>So how much money is Ajay making? Well, here is the math –</p>\n<p>Buy Price = Rs.500,000/-</p>\n<p>Add: Agreement Fees = Rs.100,000/- (remember this is a non refundable amount)</p>\n<p>Total Expense = 500,000 + 100,000 = 600,000/-</p>\n<p>Current Market of the land = Rs.10,00,000/-</p>\n<p>Hence his profit is Rs.10,00,000 – Rs.600,000 = <strong>Rs.400,000/-</strong></p>\n<p>Another way to look at this is – For an initial cash commitment of Rs.100,000/- Ajay is now making 4 times the money! Venu even though very clearly knows that the value of the land is much higher in the open market, is forced to sell it at a much lower price to Ajay. The profit that Ajay makes (Rs.400,000/-) is exactly the notional loss that Venu would incur.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Price goes down to Rs.300,000/-</strong></p>\n<p>It turns out that the highway project was just a rumour, and nothing really is expected to come out of the whole thing. People are disappointed and hence there is a sudden rush to sell out the land. As a result, the price of the land goes down to Rs.300,000/-.</p>\n<p>So what do you think Ajay will do now? Clearly it does not make sense to buy the land, hence he would walk away from the deal. Here is the math that explains why it does not make sense to buy the land –</p>\n<p>Remember the sale price is fixed at Rs.500,000/-, 6 months ago. Hence if Ajay has to buy the land he has to shell out Rs.500,000/- plus he had paid Rs.100,000/- towards the agreement fees. Which means he is in effect paying Rs.600,000/- to buy a piece of land worth just Rs.300,000/-. Clearly this would not make sense to Ajay, since he has the right to call of the deal, he would simply walk away from it and would not buy the land. However do note, as per the agreement Ajay has to let go of Rs.100,000/-, which Venu gets to pocket.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Price stays at Rs.500,000/-</strong></p>\n<p>For whatever reasons after 6 months the price stays at Rs.500,000/- and does not really change. What do you think Ajay will do? Well, he will obviously walk away from the deal and would not buy the land. Why you may ask, well here is the math –</p>\n<p>Cost of Land = Rs.500,000/-</p>\n<p>Agreement Fee = Rs.100,000/-</p>\n<p>Total = Rs.600,000/-</p>\n<p>Value of the land in open market = Rs.500,000/-</p>\n<p>Clearly it does not make sense to buy a piece of land at Rs.600,000/- when it is worth Rs.500,000/-. Do note, since Ajay has already committed 1lk, he could still buy the land, but ends up paying Rs 1lk extra in this process. For this reason Ajay will call off the deal and in the process let go of the agreement fee of Rs.100,000/- (which Venu obviously pockets).</p>\n<p>I hope you have understood this transaction clearly, and if you have then it is good news as through the example you already know how the call options work! But let us not hurry to extrapolate this to the stock markets; we will spend some more time with the Ajay-Venu transaction.</p>\n<p>Here are a few Q&amp;A’s about the transaction which will throw some more light on the example –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why do you think Ajay took such a bet even though he knows he will lose his 1 lakh if land prices does not increase or stays flat?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Agreed Ajay would lose 1 lakh, but the best part is that Ajay knows his maximum loss (which is 1 lakh) before hand. Hence there are no negative surprises for him. Also, as and when the land prices increases, so would his profits (and therefore his returns). At Rs.10,00,000/- he would be making Rs.400,000/- profit on his investment of Rs.100,000/- which is 400%.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Under what circumstances would a position such as Ajay’s make sense?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Only that scenario when the price of the land increases</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Under what circumstances would Venu’s position makes sense\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Only that scenario when the price of the land decreases or stays flat</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Why do you think Venu is taking such a big risk? He would lose a lot of money if the land prices increase after 6 months right?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Well, think about it. There are only 3 possible scenarios, out which 2 indeed benefit Venu. Statistically, Venu has 66.66% chances of winning the bet as opposed to Ajay’s 33.33% chance</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let us summarize a few important points now –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The payment from Ajay to Venu ensures that Ajay has a right (remember only he can call off the deal) and Venu has an obligation (if the situation demands, he has to honor Ajay’s claim)</li>\n<li>The outcome of the agreement at termination (end of 6 months) is determined by the price of the land. Without the land, the agreement has no value</li>\n<li>Land is therefore called an underlying and the agreement is called a derivative</li>\n<li>An agreement of this sort is called an “Options Agreement”</li>\n<li>Since Venu has received the advance from Ajay, Venu is called the ‘agreement seller or Writer’ and Ajay is called the ‘agreement buyer’</li>\n<li>In other words since this agreement is called “an options agreement”, Ajay can be called an Options Buyer and Venu the Options Seller/writer.</li>\n<li>The agreement is entered after the exchange of 1 lakh, hence 1 lakh is the price of this option agreement. This is also called the “Premium” amount</li>\n<li>Every variable in the agreement – Area of the land, price and the date of sale is fixed.</li>\n<li>As a thumb rule, in an options agreement the buyer always has a right and the seller has an obligation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would suggest you be absolutely thorough with this example. If not, please go through it again to understand the dynamics involved. Also, please remember this example, as we will revisit the same on a few occasions in the subsequent chapters.</p>\n<p>Let us now proceed to understand the same example from the stock market perspective.</p>\n<h2>1.3 – The Call Option</h2>\n<p>Let us now attempt to extrapolate the same example in the stock market context with an intention to understand the ‘Call Option’. Do note, I will deliberately skip the nitty-gritty of an option trade at this stage. The idea is to understand the bare bone structure of the call option contract.</p>\n<p>Assume a stock is trading at Rs.67/- today. You are given a right today to buy the same one month later, at say Rs. 75/-, but only if the share price on that day is more than Rs. 75, would you buy it?. Obviously you would, as this means to say that after 1 month even if the share is trading at 85, you can still get to buy it at Rs.75!</p>\n<p>In order to get this right you are required to pay a small amount today, say Rs.5.0/-. If the share price moves above Rs. 75, you can exercise your right and buy the shares at Rs. 75/-. If the share price stays at or below Rs. 75/- you do not exercise your right and you do not need to buy the shares. All you lose is Rs. 5/- in this case. An arrangement of this sort is called Option Contract, a <strong>‘Call Option’</strong> to be precise.</p>\n<p>After you get into this agreement, there are only three possibilities that can occur. And they are-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The stock price can go up, say Rs.85/-</li>\n<li>The stock price can go down, say Rs.65/-</li>\n<li>The stock price can stay at Rs.75/-</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Case 1</strong> – If the stock price goes up, then it would make sense in exercising your right and buy the stock at Rs.75/-.</p>\n<p>The P&amp;L would look like this –</p>\n<p>Price at which stock is bought = Rs.75</p>\n<p>Premium paid =Rs. 5</p>\n<p>Expense incurred = Rs.80</p>\n<p>Current Market Price = Rs.85</p>\n<p>Profit = 85 – 80 = Rs.5/-</p>\n<p><strong>Case 2 –</strong> If the stock price goes down to say Rs.65/- obviously it does not makes sense to buy it at Rs.75/- as effectively you would spending Rs.80/- (75+5) for a stock that’s available at Rs.65/- in the open market.</p>\n<p><strong>Case 3 –</strong> Likewise if the stock stays flat at Rs.75/- it simply means you are spending Rs.80/- to buy a stock which is available at Rs.75/-, hence you would not invoke your right to buy the stock at Rs.75/-.</p>\n<p>This is simple right? If you have understood this, you have essentially understood the core logic of a call option. What remains unexplained is the finer points, all of which we will learn soon.</p>\n<p>At this stage what you really need to understand is this – For reasons we have discussed so far whenever you expect the price of a stock (or any asset for that matter) to increase, it always makes sense to buy a call option!</p>\n<p>Now that we are through with the various concepts, let us understand options and their associated terms</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Variable</th>\n<th>Ajay – Venu Transaction</th>\n<th>Stock Example</th>\n<th>Remark</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Underlying</td>\n<td>1 acre land</td>\n<td>Stock</td>\n<td>Do note the concept of lot size is applicable in options. So just like in the land deal where the deal was on 1 acre land, not more or not less, the option contract will be the lot size</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expiry</td>\n<td>6 months</td>\n<td>1 month</td>\n<td>Like in futures there are 3 expiries available</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Reference Price</td>\n<td>Rs.500,000/-</td>\n<td>Rs.75/-</td>\n<td>This is also called the strike price</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Premium</td>\n<td>Rs.100,000/-</td>\n<td>Rs.5/-</td>\n<td>Do note in the stock markets, the premium changes on a minute by minute basis.

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>2.1– Decoding the basic jargons</h2>\n<p>In the previous chapter, we understood the basic call option structure. The idea of the previous chapter was to capture a few essential ‘Call Option’ concepts such as –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It makes sense to be a buyer of a call option when you expect the underlying price to increase</li>\n<li>If the underlying price remains flat or goes down then the buyer of the call option loses money</li>\n<li>The money the buyer of the call option would lose is equivalent to the premium (agreement fees) the buyer pays to the seller/writer of the call option.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the next chapter i.e. Call Option (Part 2), we will attempt to understand the call option in a bit more detail. However before we proceed further let us decode a few basic option jargons. Discussing these jargons at this stage will not only strengthen our learning, but will also make the forthcoming discussion on the options easier to comprehend.</p>\n<p>Here are a few jargons that we will look into –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Strike Price</li>\n<li>Underlying Price</li>\n<li>Exercising of an option contract</li>\n<li>Option Expiry</li>\n<li>Option Premium</li>\n<li>Option Settlement</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do remember, since we have only looked at the basic structure of a call option, I would encourage you to understand these jargons only with respect to the call option.</p>\n<p><strong>Strike Price</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch2-I1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1731\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I1.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I1-300x91.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>Consider the strike price as the anchor price at which the two parties (buyer and seller) agree to enter into an options agreement. For instance, in the previous chapter’s ‘Ajay – Venu’ example the anchor price was Rs.500,000/-, which is also the ‘Strike Price’ for their deal. We also looked into a stock example where the anchor price was Rs.75/-, which is also the strike price. For all ‘Call’ options the strike price represents the price at which the stock can be bought on the expiry day.</p>\n<p>For example, if the buyer is willing to buy ITC Limited’s Call Option of Rs.350 (350 being the strike price) then it indicates that the buyer is willing to pay a premium today to buy the rights of ‘buying ITC at Rs.350 on expiry’. Needless to say he will buy ITC at Rs.350, only if ITC is trading above Rs.350.</p>\n<p>In fact here is a snap shot from NSE’s website where I have captured different strike prices of ITC and the associated premium.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1_SP.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image 1_SP\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1728\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"440\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1_SP.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1_SP.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1_SP-300x165.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The table that you see above is called an ‘Option Chain’, which basically lists all the different strike prices available for a contract along with the premium for the same. Besides this information, the option chain has a lot more trading information such as Open Interest, volume, bid-ask quantity etc. I would suggest you ignore all of it for now and concentrate only on the highlighted information –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The highlight in maroon shows the price of the underlying in the spot. As we can see at the time of this snapshot ITC was trading at Rs.336.9 per share</li>\n<li>The highlight in blue shows all the different strike prices that are available. As we can see starting from Rs.260 (with Rs.10 intervals) we have strike prices all the way up to Rs.480</li>\n<li>Do remember, each strike price is independent of the other. One can enter into an options agreement , at a specific strike price by paying the required premium</li>\n<li>For example one can enter into a 340 call option by paying a premium of Rs.4.75/- (highlighted in red)\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>This entitles the buyer to buy ITC shares at the end of expiry at Rs.340. Of course, you now know under which circumstance it would make sense to buy ITC at 340 at the end of expiry</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Underlying Price</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch2-I2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1732\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I2.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I2-300x91.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>As we know, a derivative contract derives its value from an underlying asset. The underlying price is the price at which the underlying asset trades in the spot market. For example in the ITC example that we just discussed, ITC was trading at Rs.336.90/- in the spot market. This is the underlying price. For a call option, the underlying price has to increase for the buyer of the call option to benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Exercising of an option contract</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch2-I3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1733\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I3.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I3-300x91.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>Exercising of an option contract is the act of claiming your right to buy the options contract at the end of the expiry. If you ever hear the line “exercise the option contract” in the context of a <strong>call option</strong>, it simply means that one is claiming the right to buy the stock at the agreed strike price. Clearly he or she would do it only if the stock is trading above the strike. Here is an important point to note – you can exercise the option only on the day of the expiry and not anytime before the expiry.</p>\n<p>Hence, assume with 15 days to expiry one buys ITC 340 Call option when ITC is trading at 330 in the spot market. Further assume, after he buys the 340 call option, the stock price increases to 360 the very next day. Under such a scenario, the option buyer cannot ask for a settlement (he cannot exercise) against the call option he holds. Settlement will happen <strong>only on</strong> the day of the expiry, based on the price the asset is trading in the spot market on the expiry day.</p>\n<p><strong>Option Expiry</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch2-I4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1734\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I4.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I4.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I4-300x91.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>Similar to a futures contract, options contract also has expiry. In fact both equity futures and option contracts expire on the last Thursday of every month. Just like futures contracts, option contracts also have the concept of current month, mid month, and far month. Have a look at the snapshot below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-2_AL.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image 2_AL\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1729\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"478\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-2_AL.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-2_AL.jpg 572w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-2_AL-300x251.jpg 300w\" width=\"572\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is the snapshot of the call option to buy Ashok Leyland Ltd at the strike price of Rs.70 at Rs.3.10/-. As you can see there are 3 expiry options – 26<sup>th</sup> March 2015 (current month), 30<sup>th</sup> April 2015 (mid month), and 28<sup>th</sup> May 2015 (far month). Of course the premium of the options changes as and when the expiry changes. We will talk more about it at an appropriate time. But at this stage, I would want you to remember just two things with respect to expiry – like futures there are 3 expiry options and the premium is not the same across different expiries.</p>\n<p><strong>Option Premium</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch2-I5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1735\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I5.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I5-300x91.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>Since we have discussed premium on a couple instances previously, I guess you would now be clear about a few things with respect to the ‘Option Premium’. Premium is the money required to be paid by the option buyer to the option seller/writer. Against the payment of premium, the option buyer buys the right to exercise his desire to buy (or sell in case of put options) the asset at the strike price upon expiry.</p>\n<p>If you have got this part clear till now, I guess we are on the right track. We will now proceed to understand a new perspective on ‘Premiums’. Also, at this stage I guess it is important to let you know that the whole of option theory hinges upon ‘Option Premium’. Option premiums play an extremely crucial role when it comes to trading options. Eventually as we progress through this module you will see that the discussions will be centered heavily on the option premium.</p>\n<p>Let us revisit the ‘Ajay-Venu’ example, that we took up in the previous chapter. Consider the circumstances under which Venu accepted the premium of Rs.100,000/- from Ajay –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>News flow</strong> – The news on the highway project was only speculative and no one knew for sure if the project would indeed come up\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Think about it, we discussed 3 possible scenarios in the previous chapter out of which 2 were favorable to Venu. So besides the natural statistical edge that Venu has, the fact that the highway news is speculative only increases his chance of benefiting from the agreement</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Time</strong> – There was 6 months time to get clarity on whether the project would fructify or not.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>This point actually favors Ajay. Since there is more time to expiry the possibility of the event working in Ajay’s favor also increases. For example consider this – if you were to run 10kms, in which time duration are you more likely to achieve it – within 20 mins or within 70 mins? Obviously higher the time duration higher is the probability to achieve it.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now let us consider both these points in isolation and figure out the impact it would have on the option premium.</p>\n<p><strong>News</strong> – When the deal was done between Ajay and Venu, the news was purely speculative, hence Venu was happy to accept Rs.100,000/- as premium. However for a minute assume the news was not speculative and there was some sort of bias. Maybe there was a local politician who hinted in the recent press conference that they may consider a highway in that area. With this information, the news is no longer a rumor. Suddenly there is a possibility that the highway may indeed come up, albeit there is still an element of speculation.</p>\n<p>With this in perspective think about this – do you think Venu will accept Rs.100,000/- as premium? Maybe not, he knows there is a good chance for the highway to come up and therefore the land prices would increase. However because there is still an element of chance he may be willing to take the risk, provided the premium will be more attractive. Maybe he would consider the agreement attractive if the premium was Rs.175,000/- instead of Rs.100,000/-.</p>\n<p>Now let us put this in stock market perspective. Assume Infosys is trading at Rs.2200/- today. The 2300 Call option with a 1 month expiry is at Rs.20/-. Put yourself in Venu’s shoes (option writer) – would you enter into an agreement by accepting Rs.20/- per share as premium?</p>\n<p>If you enter into this options agreement as a writer/seller, then you are giving the right (to the buyer) of buying Infosys option at Rs. 2300 one month down the lane from now.</p>\n<p>Assume for the next 1 month there is no foreseeable corporate action which will trigger the share price of Infosys to go higher. Considering this, maybe you may accept the premium of Rs.20/-.</p>\n<p>However what if there is a corporate event (like quarterly results) that tends to increase the stock price? Will the option seller still go ahead and accept Rs.20/- as the premium for the agreement? Clearly, it may not be worth to take the risk at Rs.20/-.</p>\n<p>Having said this, what if despite the scheduled corporate event, someone is willing to offer Rs.75/- as premium instead of Rs.20/-? I suppose at Rs.75/-, it may be worth taking the risk.</p>\n<p>Let us keep this discussion at the back of our mind; we will now take up the 2<sup>nd</sup> point i.e. ‘<strong>time’</strong></p>\n<p>When there was 6 months time, clearly Ajay knew that there was ample time for the dust to settle and the truth to emerge with respect to the highway project. However instead of 6 months, what if there was only 10 days time? Since the time has shrunk there is simply not enough time for the event to unfold. Under such a circumstance (with time not being on Ajay’s side), do you think Ajay will be happy to pay Rs.100,000/- premium to Venu?. I don’t think so, as there is no incentive for Ajay to pay that kind of premium to Venu. Maybe he would offer a lesser premium, say Rs.20,000/- instead.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the point that I want to make here keeping both <strong>news and time</strong> in perspective is this – premium is never a fixed rate. It is sensitive to several factors. Some factors tend to increase the premium and some tend to decrease it, and in real markets, all these factors act simultaneously affecting the premium. To be precise there are 5 factors (similar to news and time) that tends to affect the premium. These are called the ‘Option Greeks’. We are too early to understand Greeks, but will understand the Greeks at a much later stage in this module.</p>\n<p>For now, I want you to remember and appreciate the following points with respect to option premium –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The concept of premium is pivotal to the Option Theory</li>\n<li>Premium is never a fixed rate, it is a function of many (influencing) factors</li>\n<li>In real markets premiums vary almost on a minute by minute basis</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have gathered and understood these points so far, I can assure that you are on the right path.</p>\n<p><strong>Options Settlement</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch2-I6\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1736 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"121\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I6.jpg 400w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch2-I6-300x91.jpg 300w\" width=\"400\"/></p>\n<p>Consider this Call option agreement –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-3_JP.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image 3_JP\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1730\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"483\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-3_JP.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-3_JP.jpg 575w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-3_JP-300x252.jpg 300w\" width=\"575\"/></a></p>\n<p>As highlighted in green, this is a Call Option to buy JP Associates at Rs.25/-. The expiry is 26<sup>th</sup> March 2015. The premium is Rs.1.35/- (highlighted in red), and the market lot is 8000 shares.</p>\n<p>Assume there are 2 traders – ‘Trader A’ and ‘Trader B’. Trader A wants to buy this agreement (option buyer) and Trader B wants to sell (write) this agreement. Considering the contract is for 8000 shares, here is how the cash flow would look like –</p>\n<p>Since the premium is Rs.1.35/- per share, Trader A is required to pay the total of</p>\n<p>= 8000 * 1.35</p>\n<p>= Rs.10,800/- as premium amount to Trader B.</p>\n<p>Now because Trader B has received this Premium form Trader A, he is obligated to sell Trader A 8000 shares of JP Associates on 26<sup>th</sup> March 2015, <strong>if</strong> Trader A decides to exercise his agreement. However, this does not mean that Trader B should have 8000 shares with him on 26<sup>th</sup> March. Options are cash settled in India, this means on 26<sup>th</sup> March, in the event Trader A decides to exercise his right, Trader B is obligated to pay just the cash differential to Trader A.</p>\n<p>To help you understand this better, consider on 26<sup>th</sup> March JP Associates is trading at Rs.32/-. This means the option buyer (Trader A) will exercise his right to buy 8000 shares of JP Associates at 25/-. In other words, he is getting to buy JP Associates at 25/- when the same is trading at Rs.32/- in the open market.</p>\n<p>Normally, this is how the cash flow should look like –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On 26<sup>th</sup> Trader A exercises his right to buy 8000 shares from Trader B</li>\n<li>The price at which the transaction will take place is pre decided at Rs.25 (strike price)</li>\n<li>Trader A pays Rs.200,000/- (8000 * 25) to Trader B</li>\n<li>Against this payment Trader B releases 8000 shares at Rs.25 to Trader A</li>\n<li>Trader A almost immediately sells these shares in the open market at Rs.32 per share and receives Rs.256,000/-</li>\n<li>Trader A makes a profit of Rs.56,000/- (256000 – 200000) on this transaction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another way to look at it is that the option buyer is making a profit of Rs.7/- per shares (32-25) per share. Because the option is cash settled, instead of giving the option buyer 8000 shares, the option seller directly gives him the cash equivalent of the profit he would make. Which means Trader A would receive</p>\n<p>= 7*8000</p>\n<p>= Rs.56,000/- from Trader B.</p>\n<p>Of course, the option buyer had initially spent Rs.10,800/- towards purchasing this right, hence his real profits would be –</p>\n<p>= 56,000 – 10,800</p>\n<p>= Rs.45,200/-</p>\n<p>In fact if you look at in a percentage return terms, this turns out to be a whopping return of 419% (without annualizing).</p>\n<p>The fact that one can make such large asymmetric return is what makes options an attractive instrument to trade. This is one of the reasons why Options are massively popular with traders.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Key takeaways from this chapter</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>It makes sense to buy a call option only when one anticipates an increase in the price of an asset</li>\n<li>The strike price is the anchor price at which both the option buyer and option writer enter into an agreement</li>\n<li>The underlying price is simply the spot price of the asset</li>\n<li>Exercising of an option contract is the act of claiming your right to buy the options contract at the end of the expiry</li>\n<li>Similar to futures contract, options contract also have an expiry.

In this chapter, we will formally structure our thoughts on the call option and get a firm understanding on both buying and selling of the call option. Before we move ahead any further in this chapter, here is a quick recap of what we learnt in the first chapter –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It makes sense to be a buyer of a call option when you expect the underlying price to increase</li>\n<li>If the underlying price remains flat or goes down then the buyer of the call option loses money</li>\n<li>The money the buyer of the call option would lose is equivalent to the premium (agreement fees) the buyer pays to the seller/writer of the call option</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will keep the above three points in perspective (which serves as basic guidelines) and understand the call option to a greater extent.</p>\n<h2>3.2 – Building a case for a call option</h2>\n<p>There are many situations in the market that warrants the purchase of a call option. Here is one that I just discovered while writing this chapter, thought the example would fit well in the context of our discussions. Have a look at the chart below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1_Bajaj-Auto-stock-price.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image-1_Bajaj-Auto-stock-price\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1754\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"474\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1_Bajaj-Auto-stock-price.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1_Bajaj-Auto-stock-price.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-1_Bajaj-Auto-stock-price-300x178.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The stock in consideration is Bajaj Auto Limited. As you may know, they are one of the biggest manufacturers of two wheelers in India. For various reasons the stock has been beaten down in the market, so much so that the stock is trading at its 52 week low price. I believe there could be an opportunity to initiate a trade here. Here are my thoughts with respect to this trade –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bajaj Auto is a quality fundamental stock, there is no denying this.</li>\n<li>The stock has been beaten down so heavily, makes me believe this could be the market’s over reaction to volatility in Bajaj Auto’s business cycle.</li>\n<li>I expect the stock price to stop falling sometime soon and eventually rise.</li>\n<li>However I do not want to buy the stock for delivery (yet) as I’m worried about a further decline of the stock.</li>\n<li>Extending the above point, the worry of M2M losses prevents me from buying Bajaj Auto’s futures as well.</li>\n<li>At the same time I don’t want to miss an opportunity of a sharp reversal in the stock price.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To sum up, I’m optimistic on the stock price of Bajaj Auto (the stock price to eventually increase) but I’m kind of uncertain about the immediate outlook on the stock. The uncertainty is mainly due the fact that my losses in the short term could be intense if the weakness in the stock persists. However as per my estimate the probability of the loss is low, but nevertheless the probability still exists. So what should I do?</p>\n<p>Now, if you realize I’m in a similar dilemma that was Ajay was in (recall the Ajay – Venu example from chapter 1). A circumstance such as this, builds up for a classic case of an options trade.</p>\n<p>In the context of my dilemma, clearly buying a call option on Bajaj Auto makes sense for reasons I will explain shortly. Here is a snapshot of Bajaj Auto’s option chain –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-2_Bajaj-Auto.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image-2_Bajaj-Auto\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1755\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"383\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-2_Bajaj-Auto.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-2_Bajaj-Auto.jpg 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-2_Bajaj-Auto-300x144.jpg 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>As we can see the stock is trading at Rs.2026.9 (highlighted in blue). I will choose to buy 2050 strike call option by paying a premium of Rs.6.35/- (highlighted in red box and red arrow). You may be wondering on what basis I choose the 2050 strike price when in fact there are so many different strike prices available (highlighted in green)?. Well, the process of strike price selection is a vast topic on its own, we will eventually get there in this module, but for now let us just believe 2050 is the right strike price to trade.</p>\n<h2>3.3 – Intrinsic value of a call option (upon expiry)</h2>\n<p>So what happens to the call option now considering the expiry is 15 days away? Well, broadly speaking there are three possible scenarios which I suppose you are familiar with by now –</p>\n<p>Scenario 1 – The stock price goes above the strike price, say 2080</p>\n<p>Scenario 2 – The stock price goes below the strike price, say 2030</p>\n<p>Scenario 3 – The stock price stays at 2050</p>\n<p>The above 3 scenarios are very similar to the ones we had looked at in chapter 1, hence I will also assume that you are familiar with the P&amp;L calculation at the specific value of the spot in the  given scenarios above (if not, I would suggest you read through Chapter 1 again).</p>\n<p>The idea I’m interested in exploring now is this –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You will agree there are only 3 broad scenarios under which the price movement of Bajaj Auto can be classified (upon expiry) i.e. the price either increases, decreases, or stays flat</li>\n<li>But what about all the different prices in between? For example if as per Scenario 1 the price is considered to be at 2080 which is above the strike of 2050. What about other strike prices such as 2055, 2060, 2065, 2070 etc? Can we generalize anything here with respect to the P&amp;L?</li>\n<li>In scenario 2, the price is considered to be at 2030 which is below the strike of 2050. What about other strike prices such as 2045, 2040, 2035 etc? Can we generalize anything here with respect to the P&amp;L?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What would happen to the P&amp;L at various possible prices of spot (upon expiry) – I would like to call these points as the “Possible values of the spot on expiry” and sort of generalize the P&amp;L understanding of the call option.</p>\n<p>In order to do this, I would like to first talk about (<strong>in part and not the full concept</strong>) the idea of the ‘intrinsic value of the option upon expiry’.</p>\n<p>The intrinsic value (IV) of the option upon expiry (<strong>specifically a call option for now</strong>) is defined as the <strong>non – negative value</strong> which the option buyer is entitled to if he were to exercise the call option. In simple words ask yourself (assuming you are the buyer of a call option) how much money you would receive upon expiry, if the call option you hold is profitable. Mathematically it is defined as –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">IV = Spot Price – Strike Price</strong></p>\n<p>So if Bajaj Auto on the day of expiry is trading at 2068 (in the spot market) the 2050 Call option’s intrinsic value would be –</p>\n<p>= 2068 – 2050</p>\n<p>= 18</p>\n<p>Likewise, if Bajaj Auto is trading at 2025 on the expiry day the intrinsic value of the option would be –</p>\n<p>= 2025 – 2050</p>\n<p>= -25</p>\n<p>But remember, IV of an option (irrespective of a call or put) is a non negative number; hence we leave the IV at 2025</p>\n<p>= <strong>0</strong></p>\n<p>Now our objective is to keep the idea of intrinsic value of the option in perspective, and to identify how much money I will make at every possible expiry value of Bajaj Auto and in the process make some generalizations on the call option buyer’s P&amp;L.</p>\n<h2>3.4 – Generalizing the P&amp;L for a call option buyer</h2>\n<p>Now keeping the concept of intrinsic value of an option at the back of our mind, let us work towards building a table which would help us identify how much money, I as the buyer of Bajaj Auto’s 2050 call option would make under the various possible spot value changes of Bajaj Auto (in spot market) on expiry. Do remember the premium paid for this option is Rs 6.35/–. Irrespective of how the spot value changes, the fact that I have paid Rs.6.35/- remains unchanged. This is the cost that I have incurred in order to buy the 2050 Call Option. Let us keep this in perspective and work out the P&amp;L table –</p>\n<p><em>Please note – the negative sign before the premium paid represents a cash out flow from my trading account. </em></p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Serial No.</th>\n<th>Possible values of spot</th>\n<th>Premium Paid</th>\n<th>Intrinsic Value (IV)</th>\n<th>P&amp;L (IV + Premium)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>1990</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>1990 – 2050 = 0</td>\n<td>= 0 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 6.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>2000</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2000 – 2050 = 0</td>\n<td>= 0 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 6.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>2010</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2010 – 2050 = 0</td>\n<td>= 0 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 6.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>2020</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2020 – 2050 = 0</td>\n<td>= 0 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 6.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>2030</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2030 – 2050 = 0</td>\n<td>= 0 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 6.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td>2040</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2040 – 2050 = 0</td>\n<td>= 0 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 6.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td>2050</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2050 – 2050 = 0</td>\n<td>= 0 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 6.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td>2060</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2060 – 2050 = 10</td>\n<td>= 10 +(-6.35) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 3.65</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td>2070</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2070 – 2050 = 20</td>\n<td>= 20 +(-6.35) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 13.65</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>2080</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2080 – 2050 = 30</td>\n<td>= 30 +(-6.35) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 23.65</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>2090</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2090 – 2050 = 40</td>\n<td>= 40 +(-6.35) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 33.65</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>2100</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2100 – 2050 = 50</td>\n<td>= 50 +(-6.35) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 43.65</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So what do you observe? The table above throws out 2 strong observations –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Even if the price of Bajaj Auto goes down (below the strike price of 2050), the maximum loss seems to be just Rs.6.35/-\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><strong>Generalization 1</strong> – For a call option buyer a loss occurs when the spot price moves below the strike price. However the loss to the call option buyer is <strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">restricted </strong>to the extent of the premium he has paid</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The profit from this call option seems to increase exponentially as and when Bajaj Auto starts to move above the strike price of 2050\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><strong>Generalization 2 – </strong>The call option becomes profitable as and when the spot price moves over and above the strike price. The higher the spot price goes from the strike price, the higher the profit.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>From the above 2 generalizations it is fair for us to say that the buyer of the call option has a limited risk and a potential to make an unlimited profit.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is a general formula that tells you the Call option P&amp;L for a given spot price –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">P&amp;L = Max [0, (Spot Price – Strike Price)] – Premium Paid</strong></p>\n<p>Going by the above formula, let’s evaluate the P&amp;L for a few possible spot values on expiry –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>2023</li>\n<li>2072</li>\n<li>2055</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The solution is as follows –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">@2023</strong></p>\n<p>= Max [0, (2023 – 2050)] – 6.35</p>\n<p>= Max [0, (-27)] – 6.35</p>\n<p>= 0 – 6.35</p>\n<p>= <strong>– 6.35</strong></p>\n<p>The answer is in line with Generalization 1 (loss restricted to the extent of premium paid).</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">@2072</strong></p>\n<p>= Max [0, (2072 – 2050)] – 6.35</p>\n<p>= Max [0, (+22)] – 6.35</p>\n<p>= 22 – 6.35</p>\n<p>= <strong>+15.65</strong></p>\n<p>The answer is in line with Generalization 2 (Call option gets profitable as and when the spot price moves over and above the strike price).</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">@2055</strong></p>\n<p>= Max [0, (2055 – 2050)] – 6.35</p>\n<p>= Max [0, (+5)] – 6.35</p>\n<p>= 5 – 6.35</p>\n<p>= <strong>-1.35</strong></p>\n<p>So, here is a tricky situation, the result what we obtained here is against the 2<sup>nd</sup> generalization. Despite the spot price being above the strike price, the trade is resulting in a loss! Why is this so? Also if you observe the loss is much lesser than the maximum loss of Rs.6.35/-, it is in fact just Rs.1.35/-. To understand why this is happening we should diligently inspect the P&amp;L behavior around the spot value which is slightly above the strike price (2050 in this case).</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Serial No.</th>\n<th>Possible values of spot</th>\n<th>Premium Paid</th>\n<th>Intrinsic Value (IV)</th>\n<th>P&amp;L (IV + Premium)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>2050</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2050 – 2050 = 0</td>\n<td>= 0 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 6.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>2051</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2051 – 2050 = 1</td>\n<td>= 1 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 5.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>2052</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2052 – 2050 = 2</td>\n<td>= 2 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 4.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>2053</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2053 – 2050 = 3</td>\n<td>= 3 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 3.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>2054</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2054 – 2050 = 4</td>\n<td>= 4 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 2.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td>2055</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2055 – 2050 = 5</td>\n<td>= 5 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 1.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td>2056</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2056 – 2050 = 6</td>\n<td>= 6 + (– 6.35) = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 0.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td>2057</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2057 – 2050 = 7</td>\n<td>= 7 +(- 6.35) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 0.65</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td>2058</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2058 – 2050 = 8</td>\n<td>= 8 +(- 6.35) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 1.65</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>2059</td>\n<td>(-) 6.35</td>\n<td>2059 – 2050 = 9</td>\n<td>= 9 +(- 6.35) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 2.65</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As you notice from the table above, the buyer suffers a maximum loss (Rs. 6.35 in this case) till the spot price is equal to the strike price. However, when the spot price starts to move above the strike price, the loss starts to <strong>minimize. </strong>The losses keep getting minimized till a point where the trade neither results in a profit or a loss. This is called the <strong>breakeven point</strong>.</p>\n<p>The formula to identify the breakeven point for any call option is –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">B.E = Strike Price + Premium Paid</strong></p>\n<p>For the Bajaj Auto example, the ‘Break Even’ point is –</p>\n<p>= 2050 + 6.35</p>\n<p>= <strong>2056.35</strong></p>\n<p>In fact let us find out find out the P&amp;L at the breakeven point</p>\n<p>= Max [0, (2056.35 – 2050)] – 6.35</p>\n<p>= Max [0, (+6.35)] – 6.35</p>\n<p>= +6.35 – 6.35</p>\n<p><strong>= 0</strong></p>\n<p>As you can see, at the breakeven point we neither make money nor lose money. In other words, if the call option has to be profitable it not only has to move above the strike price but it has to move above the breakeven point.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch3-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1757\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch3-title.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch3-title.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/M5-Ch3-title-300x150.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>3.5 – Call option buyer’s payoff</h2>\n<p>So far we have understood a few very important features with respect to a call option buyer’s payoff; I will reiterate the same –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The maximum loss the buyer of a call option experiences is, to the extent of the premium paid. The buyer experiences a loss as long as the spot price is below the strike price</li>\n<li>The call option buyer has the potential to realize unlimited profits provided the spot price moves higher than the strike price</li>\n<li>Though the call option is supposed to make a profit when the spot price moves above the strike price, the call option buyer first needs to recover the premium he has paid</li>\n<li>The point at which the call option buyer completely recovers the premium he has paid is called the breakeven point</li>\n<li>The call option buyer truly starts making a profit only beyond the breakeven point (which naturally is above the strike price)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Interestingly, all these points can be visualized if we plot the chart of the P&amp;L. Here is the P&amp;L chart of Bajaj Auto’s Call Option trade –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-3_Payoff.jpg\"><img alt=\"Image-3_Payoff\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1756\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"327\" sizes=\"(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-3_Payoff.jpg\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-3_Payoff.jpg 513w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Image-3_Payoff-300x191.jpg 300w\" width=\"513\"/></a></p>\n<p>From the chart above you can notice the following points which are in line with the discussion we have just had –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The loss is restricted to Rs.6.35/- as long as the spot price is trading at any price below the strike of 2050</li>\n<li>From 2050 to 2056.35 (breakeven price) we can see the losses getting minimized</li>\n<li>At 2056.35 we can see that there is neither a profit nor a loss</li>\n<li>Above 2056.35 the call option starts making money. In fact the slope of the P&amp;L line clearly indicates that the profits start increasing exponentially as and when the spot value moves away from the strike</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Again, from the graph one thing is very evident – A call option buyer has a limited risk but unlimited profit potential. And with this I hope you are now clear with the call option from the buyer’s perspective.

The movie is about two brothers from the same mother. While one brother, righteous in life grows up to become a cop, the other brother turns out to be a notorious criminal whose views about life is diametrically opposite to his cop brother.</p>\n<p>Well, the reason why I’m talking about this legendary movie now is that the option writer and the option buyer are somewhat comparable to these brothers. They are the two sides of the same coin. Of course, unlike the Deewaar brothers there is no view on morality when it comes to Options trading; rather the view is more on markets and what one expects out of the markets. However, there is one thing that you should remember here – whatever happens to the option seller in terms of the P&amp;L, the exact opposite happens to option buyer and vice versa. For example if the option writer is making Rs.70/- in profits, this automatically means the option buyer is losing Rs.70/-. Here is a quick list of such generalisations –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the option buyer has <strong>limited risk</strong> (to the extent of premium paid), then the option seller has <strong>limited profit</strong> (again to the extent of the premium he receives)</li>\n<li>If the option buyer has <strong>unlimited profit</strong> potential then the option seller potentially has <strong>unlimited risk</strong></li>\n<li>The breakeven point is the point at which the option buyer starts to make money, this is the exact same point at which the option writer starts to lose money</li>\n<li>If option buyer is making Rs.X in profit, then it implies the option seller is making a loss of Rs.X</li>\n<li>If the option buyer is losing Rs.X, then it implies the option seller is making Rs.X in profits</li>\n<li>Lastly if the option buyer is of the opinion that the market price will increase (above the strike price to be particular) then the option seller would be of the opinion that the market will stay <strong>at or below</strong> the strike price…and vice versa.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To appreciate these points further it would make sense to take a look at the Call Option from the seller’s perspective, which is the objective of this chapter.</p>\n<p>Before we proceed, I have to warn you something about this chapter – since there is P&amp;L symmetry between the option seller and the buyer, the discussion going forward in this chapter will look very similar to the discussion we just had in the previous chapter, hence there is a possibility that you could just skim through the chapter. Please don’t do that, I would suggest you stay alert to notice the subtle difference and the <strong>huge impact</strong> it has on the P&amp;L of the call option writer.</p>\n<h2>4.2 – Call option seller and his thought process</h2>\n<p>Recall the ‘Ajay-Venu’ real estate example from chapter 1 – we discussed 3 possible scenarios that would take the agreement to a logical conclusion –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The price of the land moves above Rs.500,000 (good for Ajay – option buyer)</li>\n<li>The price stays flat at Rs.500,000 (good for Venu – option seller)</li>\n<li>The price moves lower than Rs.500,000 (good for Venu – option seller)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you notice, the option buyer has a statistical <strong>disadvantage</strong> when he buys options – only 1 possible scenario out of the three benefits the option buyer. In other words 2 out of the 3 scenarios benefit the option seller. This is just <strong>one</strong> of the incentives for the option writer to sell options. Besides this natural statistical edge, if the option seller also has a good market insight then the chances of the option seller being profitable are quite high.</p>\n<p>Please do note, I’m only talking about a natural statistical edge here and by no way am I suggesting that an option seller will always make money.</p>\n<p>Anyway let us now take up the same ‘Bajaj Auto’ example we took up in the previous chapter and build a case for a <strong>call option seller</strong> and understand how he would view the same situation.

The most important point to note here is – the option seller is selling a call option because he believes that the price of Bajaj Auto will NOT increase in the near future. Therefore he believes that, selling the call option and collecting the premium is a good strategy.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned in the previous chapter, selecting the right strike price is a very important aspect of options trading. We will talk about this in greater detail as we go forward in this module. For now, let us assume the option seller decides to sell Bajaj Auto’s 2050 strike option and collect Rs.6.35/- as premiums. Please refer to the option chain below for the details –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-2_Bajaj-Auto.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_Bajaj Auto\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1806\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"383\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-2_Bajaj-Auto.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-2_Bajaj-Auto.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-2_Bajaj-Auto-300x144.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Let us now run through the same exercise that we ran through in the previous chapter to understand the P&amp;L profile of the call option seller and in the process make the required generalizations.

He would experience a loss only after he losses the entire premium. Meaning after receiving a premium of Rs.6.35, if he loses Rs.5/- it implies he is still in profit of Rs.1.35/-. Hence for an option seller to experience a loss he has to first lose the premium he has received, any money he loses over and above the premium received, will be his real loss. Hence the P&amp;L calculation would be ‘Premium – Intrinsic Value’</li>\n<li>You can extend the same argument to the option buyer. Since the option buyer pays a premium, he first needs to recover the premium he has paid, hence he would be profitable over and above the premium amount he has received, hence the P&amp;L calculation would be ‘ Intrinsic Value – Premium’.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The table above should be familiar to you now. Let us inspect the table and make a few generalizations (do bear in mind the strike price is 2050) –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As long as Bajaj Auto stays at or below the strike price of 2050, the option seller gets to make money – as in he gets to pocket the entire premium of Rs.6.35/-. However, do note the profit remains constant at Rs.6.35/-.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><strong>Generalization 1</strong> – The call option writer experiences a maximum profit to the extent of the premium received as long as the spot price remains at or below the strike price (for a call option)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The option writer experiences a loss as and when Bajaj Auto starts to move above the strike price of 2050\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><strong>Generalization 2 – </strong>The call option writer starts to lose money as and when the spot price moves over and above the strike price. Higher the spot price moves away from the strike price, larger the loss.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>From the above 2 generalizations, it is fair to conclude that, the option seller can earn limited profits and can experience unlimited loss</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can put these generalizations in a formula to estimate the P&amp;L of a Call option seller –</p>\n<p><strong>P&amp;L = Premium – Max [0, (Spot Price – Strike Price)]</strong></p>\n<p>Going by the above formula, let’s evaluate the P&amp;L for a few possible spot values on expiry –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>2023</li>\n<li>2072</li>\n<li>2055</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The solution is as follows –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">@2023</strong></p>\n<p>= 6.35 – Max [0, (2023 – 2050)]</p>\n<p>= 6.35 – Max [0, -27]</p>\n<p>= 6.35 – 0</p>\n<p>= <strong>6.35</strong></p>\n<p>The answer is in line with Generalization 1 (profit restricted to the extent of premium received).</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">@2072</strong></p>\n<p>= 6.35 – Max [0, (2072 – 2050)]</p>\n<p>= 6.35 – 22</p>\n<p>= <strong>-15.56</strong></p>\n<p>The answer is in line with Generalization 2 (Call option writers would experience a loss as and when the spot price moves over and above the strike price)</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">@2055</strong></p>\n<p>= 6.35 – Max [0, (2055 – 2050)]</p>\n<p>= 6.35 – Max [0, +5]</p>\n<p>= 6.35 – 5</p>\n<p>= <strong>1.35</strong></p>\n<p>Though the spot price is higher than the strike, the call option writer still seems to be making some money here. This is against the 2<sup>nd</sup> generalization. I’m sure you would know this by now, this is because of the ‘breakeven point’ concept, which we discussed in the previous chapter.</p>\n<p>Anyway let us inspect this a bit further and look at the P&amp;L behavior in and around the strike price to see exactly at which point the option writer will start making a loss.</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Serial No.</th>\n<th>Possible values of spot</th>\n<th>Premium Received</th>\n<th>Intrinsic Value (IV)</th>\n<th>P&amp;L (Premium – IV)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>2050</td>\n<td>+ 6.35</td>\n<td>2050 – 2050 = 0</td>\n<td>= 6.35 – 0 = <span style=\"color: green;\">6.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>2051</td>\n<td>+ 6.35</td>\n<td>2051 – 2050 = 1</td>\n<td>= 6.35 – 1 = <span style=\"color: green;\">5.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>2052</td>\n<td>+ 6.35</td>\n<td>2052 – 2050 = 2</td>\n<td>= 6.35 – 2 = <span style=\"color: green;\">4.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>2053</td>\n<td>+ 6.35</td>\n<td>2053 – 2050 = 3</td>\n<td>= 6.35 – 3 = <span style=\"color: green;\">3.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>2054</td>\n<td>+ 6.35</td>\n<td>2054 – 2050 = 4</td>\n<td>= 6.35 – 4 = <span style=\"color: green;\">2.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td>2055</td>\n<td>+ 6.35</td>\n<td>2055 – 2050 = 5</td>\n<td>= 6.35 – 5 = <span style=\"color: green;\">1.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td>2056</td>\n<td>+ 6.35</td>\n<td>2056 – 2050 = 6</td>\n<td>= 6.35 – 6 = <span style=\"color: green;\">0.35</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td>2057</td>\n<td>+ 6.35</td>\n<td>2057 – 2050 = 7</td>\n<td>= 6.35 – 7 = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 0.65</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td>2058</td>\n<td>+ 6.35</td>\n<td>2058 – 2050 = 8</td>\n<td>= 6.35 – 8 = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 1.65</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>2059</td>\n<td>+ 6.35</td>\n<td>2059 – 2050 = 9</td>\n<td>= 6.35 – 9 = <span style=\"color: red;\">– 2.65</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Clearly even when the spot price moves higher than the strike, the option writer still makes money, he continues to make money till the spot price increases more than <strong>strike + premium</strong> received. At this point he starts to lose money, hence calling this the ‘<strong>breakdown point</strong>’ seems appropriate.</p>\n<p><strong>Breakdown point for the call option seller = Strike Price + Premium Received</strong></p>\n<p>For the Bajaj Auto example,</p>\n<p>= 2050 + 6.35</p>\n<p><strong>= 2056.35</strong></p>\n<p>So, the breakeven point for a call option buyer becomes the breakdown point for the call option seller.</p>\n<h2>4.3 – Call Option seller pay-off</h2>\n<p>As we have seen throughout this chapter, there is a great symmetry between the call option buyer and the seller. In fact the same can be observed if we plot the P&amp;L graph of an option seller. Here is the same –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3_Short-call-pay-off.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_Short call pay off\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1807\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"327\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3_Short-call-pay-off.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3_Short-call-pay-off.png 524w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3_Short-call-pay-off-300x187.png 300w\" width=\"524\"/></a></p>\n<p>The call option sellers P&amp;L payoff looks like a mirror image of the call option buyer’s P&amp;L pay off. From the chart above you can notice the following points which are in line with the discussion we have just had –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The profit is restricted to Rs.6.35/- as long as the spot price is trading at any price below the strike of 2050</li>\n<li>From 2050 to 2056.35 (breakdown price) we can see the profits getting minimized</li>\n<li>At 2056.35 we can see that there is neither a profit nor a loss</li>\n<li>Above 2056.35 the call option seller starts losing money. In fact, the slope of the P&amp;L line clearly indicates that the losses start to increase as and when the spot value moves away from the strike price</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>4.4 – A note on margins</h2>\n<p>Think about the risk profile of both the call option buyer and a call option seller. The call option buyer bears no risk. He just has to pay the required premium amount to the call option seller, against which he would buy the right to buy the underlying at a later point. We know his risk (maximum loss) is restricted to the premium he has already paid.</p>\n<p>However, when you think about the risk profile of a call option seller, we know that he bears an unlimited risk. His potential loss can increase as and when the spot price moves above the strike price. Having said this, think about the stock exchange – how can they manage the risk exposure of an option seller in the backdrop of an ‘unlimited loss’ potential? What if the loss becomes so huge that the option seller decides to default?</p>\n<p>Clearly, the stock exchange cannot afford to permit a derivative participant to carry such a huge default risk, hence it is mandatory for the option seller to park some money as margins. The margins charged for an option seller is similar to the margin requirement for a futures contract.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot from the Zerodha Margin calculator for Bajaj Auto futures and Bajaj Auto 2050 Call option, both expiring on 30<sup>th</sup> April 2015.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-4_Futures-Margin.png\"><img alt=\"Image 4_Futures Margin\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1808\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"351\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-4_Futures-Margin.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-4_Futures-Margin.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-4_Futures-Margin-300x132.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>And here is the margin requirement for selling 2050 call option.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-5_-Options-Margin.png\"><img alt=\"Image 5_ Options Margin\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1809\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"382\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-5_-Options-Margin.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-5_-Options-Margin.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-5_-Options-Margin-300x143.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see the margin requirements are somewhat similar in both the cases (option writing and trading futures). Of course there is a small difference; we will deal with it at a later stage. For now, I just want you to note that option selling requires margins similar to futures trading, and the margin amount is roughly the same.</p>\n<h2>4.5 – Putting things together</h2>\n<p>I hope the last four chapters have given you all the clarity you need with respect to call options buying and selling. Unlike other topics in Finance, options are a little heavy duty. Hence I guess it makes sense to consolidate our learning at every opportunity and then proceed further. Here are the key things you should remember with respect to buying and selling call options.</p>\n<p><em>With respect to option buying</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You buy a call option only when you are bullish about the underlying asset. Upon expiry the call option will be profitable only if the underlying has moved over and above the strike price</li>\n<li>Buying a call option is also referred to as ‘Long on a Call Option’ or simply ‘<strong>Long Call</strong>’</li>\n<li>To buy a call option you need to pay a premium to the option writer</li>\n<li>The call option buyer has limited risk (to the extent of the premium paid) and an potential to make an unlimited profit</li>\n<li>The breakeven point is the point at which the call option buyer neither makes money nor experiences a loss</li>\n<li>P&amp;L = Max [0, (Spot Price – Strike Price)] – Premium Paid</li>\n<li>Breakeven point = Strike Price + Premium Paid</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>With respect to option selling</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You sell a call option (also called option writing) only when you believe that upon expiry, the underlying asset will not increase beyond the strike price</li>\n<li>Selling a call option is also called ‘Shorting a call option’ or simply ‘<strong>Short Call</strong>’</li>\n<li>When you sell a call option you receive the premium amount</li>\n<li>The profit of an option seller is restricted to the premium he receives, however his loss is potentially unlimited</li>\n<li>The breakdown point is the point at which the call option seller gives up all the premium he has made, which means he is neither making money nor is losing money</li>\n<li>Since short option position carries unlimited risk, he is required to deposit margin</li>\n<li>Margins in case of short options is similar to futures margin</li>\n<li>P&amp;L = Premium – Max [0, (Spot Price – Strike Price)]</li>\n<li>Breakdown point = Strike Price + Premium Received</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Other important points</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you are bullish on a stock you can either buy the stock in spot, buy its futures, or buy a call option</li>\n<li>When you are bearish on a stock you can either sell the stock in the spot (although on a intraday basis), short futures, or short a call option</li>\n<li>The calculation of the intrinsic value for call option is standard, it does not change based on whether you are an option buyer/ seller</li>\n<li>However the intrinsic value calculation changes for a ‘Put’ option</li>\n<li>The net P&amp;L calculation methodology is different for the call option buyer and seller.</li>\n<li>Throughout the last 4 chapters we have looked at the P&amp;L keeping the expiry in perspective, this is only to help you understand the P&amp;L behavior better</li>\n<li>One need not wait for the option expiry to figure out if he is going to be profitable or not</li>\n<li>Most of the option trading is based on the change in premiums</li>\n<li>For example, if I have bought Bajaj Auto 2050 call option at Rs.6.35 in the morning and by noon the same is trading at Rs.9/- I can choose to sell and book profits</li>\n<li>The premiums change dynamically all the time, it changes because of many variables at play, we will understand all of them as we proceed through this module</li>\n<li>Call option is abbreviated as ‘CE’. So Bajaj Auto 2050 Call option is also referred to as Bajaj Auto 2050CE. CE is an abbreviation for ‘European Call Option’.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>4.6 – European versus American Options</h2>\n<p>Initially when option was introduced in India, there are two types of options available – European and American Options. All index options (Nifty, Bank Nifty options) were European in nature and the stock options were American in nature. The difference between the two was mainly in terms of ‘Options exercise’.</p>\n<p><strong>European Options</strong> – If the option type is European then it means that the option buyer will have to mandatory wait till the expiry date to exercise his right. <strong>The settlement is based on the value of spot market on expiry day</strong>. For example if he has bought a Bajaj Auto 2050 Call option, then for the buyer to be profitable Bajaj Auto has to go higher than the breakeven point on the day of the expiry. Even not it the option is worthless to the buyer and he will lose all the premium money that he paid to the Option seller.</p>\n<p><strong>American Options – </strong>In an American Option, the option buyer can exercise his right to buy the option whenever he deems appropriate during the tenure of the options expiry. <strong>The settlement is dependent of the spot market at that given moment and not really depended on expiry</strong>. For instance he buys Bajaj Auto 2050 Call option today when Bajaj is trading at 2030 in spot market and there are 20 more days for expiry. The next day Bajaj Auto crosses 2050. In such a case, the buyer of Baja Auto 2050 American Call option can exercise his right, which means the seller is obligated to settle with the option buyer. The expiry date has little significance here.</p>\n<p>For people familiar with option you may have this question – ‘Since we can anyway buy an option now and sell it later, maybe in 30 minutes after we purchase, how does it matter if the option is American or European?’.</p>\n<p>Valid question, well think about the Ajay-Venu example again. Here Ajay and Venu were to revisit the agreement in 6 months time (this is like a European Option). If instead of 6 months, imagine if Ajay had insisted that he could come anytime during the tenure of the agreement and claim his right (like an American Option). For example there could be a strong rumor about the highway project (after they signed off the agreement). In the back of the strong rumor, the land prices shoots up and hence Ajay decides exercise his right, clearly Venu will be obligated to deliver the land to Ajay (even though he is very clear that the land price has gone up because of strong rumors). Now because Venu carries addition risk of getting ‘exercised’ on any day as opposed to the day of the expiry, the premium he would need is also higher (so that he is compensated for the risk he takes).</p>\n<p>For this reason, American options are always more expensive than European Options.</p>\n<p>Also, you maybe interested to know that about 3 years ago NSE decided to get rid of American option completely from the derivatives segment. <strong>So all options in India are now European in nature</strong>, which means the buyer can exercise his option based on the spot price on the expiry day.</p>\n<p>We will now proceed to understand the ‘Put Options’.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>You sell a call option when you are bearish on a stock</li>\n<li>The call option buyer and the seller have a symmetrically opposite P&amp;L behaviour</li>\n<li>When you sell a call option you receive a premium</li>\n<li>Selling a call option requires you to deposit a margin</li>\n<li>When you sell a call option your profit is limited to the extent of the premium you receive and your loss can potentially be unlimited</li>\n<li>P&amp;L = Premium – Max [0, (Spot Price – Strike Price)]</li>\n<li>Breakdown point = Strike Price + Premium Received</li>\n<li>In India, all options are European in nature</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

If you are indeed familiar with the call option then orienting yourself to understand ‘Put Options’ is fairly easy.  The only change in a put option (from the buyer’s perspective) is the view on markets should be bearish as opposed to the bullish view of a call option buyer.</p>\n<p>The put option buyer is betting on the fact that the stock price will go down (by the time expiry approaches). Hence in order to profit from this view, he enters into a Put Option agreement. In a put option agreement, the buyer of the put option can buy the right to sell a stock at a price (strike price) irrespective of where the underlying/stock is trading at.</p>\n<p>Remember this generality – whatever the buyer of the option anticipates, the seller anticipates the exact opposite, therefore a market exists. After all, if everyone expects the same a market can never exist. So if the Put option buyer expects the market to go down by expiry, then the put option seller would expect the market (or the stock) to go up or stay flat.</p>\n<p>A put option buyer <strong>buys the right to sell</strong> the underlying to the put option writer at a predetermined rate (Strike price. This means the put option seller, upon expiry will have to buy if the ‘put option buyer’ is selling him.  Pay attention here – at the time of the agreement the put option seller is selling a right to the put option buyer wherein the buyer can ‘sell’ the underlying to the ‘put option seller’ at the time of expiry.</p>\n<p>Confusing? well, just think of the ‘Put Option’ as a simple contract where two parties meet today and agree to enter into a transaction based on the price of an underlying –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The party agreeing to pay a premium is called the ‘contract buyer’ and the party receiving the premium is called the ‘contract seller’</li>\n<li>The contract buyer pays a premium and buys himself a <strong>right</strong></li>\n<li>The contract seller receives the premium and <strong>obligates</strong> himself</li>\n<li>The contract buyer will decide whether or not to exercise his right on the expiry day</li>\n<li>If the contract buyer decides to exercise his right then he gets to sell the underlying (maybe a stock) at the agreed price (strike price) and the contract seller will be obligated to buy this underlying from the contract buyer</li>\n<li>Obviously, the contract buyer will exercise his right only if the underlying price is trading below the strike price – this means by virtue of the contract the buyer holds, he can sell the underlying at a much higher price to the contract seller when the same underlying is trading at a lower price in the open market.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Still, confusing? Fear not, we will deal with an example to understand this more clearly.</p>\n<p>Consider this situation, between the <strong>Contract buyer</strong> and the <strong>Contract seller</strong> –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume Reliance Industries is trading at Rs.850/-</li>\n<li>Contract buyer buys the right to sell Reliance to contract seller at Rs.850/- upon expiry</li>\n<li>To obtain this right, the contract buyer has to pay a premium to the contract seller</li>\n<li>Against the receipt of the premium, contract seller will agree to buy Reliance Industries shares at Rs.850/- upon expiry but only if contract buyer wants him to buy it from him</li>\n<li>For example, if upon expiry Reliance is at Rs.820/- then contract buyer can demand contract seller to buy Reliance at Rs.850/- from him</li>\n<li>This means contract buyer can enjoy the benefit of selling Reliance at Rs.850/- when it is trading at a lower price in the open market (Rs.820/-)</li>\n<li>If Reliance is trading at Rs.850/- or higher upon expiry (say Rs.870/-) it does not make sense for contract buyer to exercise his right and ask contract seller to buy the shares from him at Rs.850/-. This is quite obvious since he can sell it at a higher rate in the open market</li>\n<li>An agreement of this sort where one obtains the right to sell the underlying asset upon expiry is called a ‘Put option’</li>\n<li>Contract seller will be obligated to buy Reliance at Rs.850/- from contract buyer because he has sold Reliance 850 Put Option to the contract buyer</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch5-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1850\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/M5-Ch5-title.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/M5-Ch5-title.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/M5-Ch5-title-300x150.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>I hope the above discussion has given you the required orientation to the Put Options. If you are still confused, it is alright as I’m certain you will develop more clarity as we proceed further. However, there are 3 key points you need to be aware of at this stage –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The buyer of the put option is bearish about the underlying asset, while the seller of the put option is neutral or bullish on the same underlying</li>\n<li>The buyer of the put option has the right to sell the underlying asset upon expiry at the strike price</li>\n<li>The seller of the put option is obligated (since he receives an upfront premium) to buy the underlying asset at the strike price from the put option buyer if the buyer wishes to exercise his right.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>5.2 – Building a case for a Put Option buyer</h2>\n<p>Like we did with the call option, let us build a practical case to understand the put option better. We will first deal with the Put Option from the buyer’s perspective and then proceed to understand the put option from the seller’s perspective.</p>\n<p>Here is the end of day chart of Bank Nifty (as on 8<sup>th</sup> April 2015) –</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Image 1_ Bank Nifty\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1846\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"474\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-1_-Bank-Nifty.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-1_-Bank-Nifty.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-1_-Bank-Nifty-300x178.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>Here are some of my thoughts with respect to Bank Nifty –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bank Nifty is trading at 18417</li>\n<li>2 days ago Bank Nifty tested its resistance level of 18550 (resistance level highlighted by a green horizontal line)</li>\n<li>I consider 18550 as resistance since there is a price action zone at this level which is well spaced in time (for people who are not familiar with the concept of resistance I would suggest you read about it <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/support-resistance/\"><strong>here</strong></a></li>\n<li>I have highlighted the price action zone in blue rectangular boxes</li>\n<li>On 7<sup>th</sup> of April (yesterday), RBI maintained a status quo on the monetary rates – they kept the key central bank rates unchanged (as you may know RBI monetary policy is the most important event for Bank Nifty)</li>\n<li>Hence in the backdrop of technical resistance and lack of any key fundamental trigger, banks may not be the flavour of the season in the markets</li>\n<li>As a result of which traders may want to sell banks and buy something else which is the flavour of the season</li>\n<li>For these reasons I have a bearish bias towards Bank Nifty</li>\n<li>However shorting futures maybe a bit risky as the overall market is bullish, it is only the banking sector which is lacking lustre</li>\n<li>Under circumstances such as these employing an option is best, hence buying a Put Option on the bank Nifty may make sense</li>\n<li>Remember when you buy a put option you benefit when the underlying goes down</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Backed by this reasoning, I would prefer to buy the 18400 Put Option which is trading at a premium of Rs.315/-. Remember to buy this 18400 Put option, I will have to pay the required premium (Rs.315/- in this case) and the same will be received by the 18400 Put option seller.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-2_Option-Chain.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_Option Chain\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1847\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"458\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-2_Option-Chain.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-2_Option-Chain.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-2_Option-Chain-300x172.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Of course, buying the Put option is quite simple – the easiest way is to call your broker and ask him to buy the Put option of a specific stock and strike and it will be done for you in a matter of a few seconds. Alternatively, you can buy it yourself through a trading terminal such as <a href=\"http://www.zerodha.com/pi\"><strong>Zerodha Pi</strong></a> We will get into the technicalities of buying and selling options via a trading terminal at a later stage.</p>\n<p>Now assuming I have bought Bank Nifty’s 18400 Put Option, it would be interesting to observe the P&amp;L behaviour of the Put Option upon its expiry.  In the process, we can even make a few generalizations about the behaviour of a Put option’s P&amp;L.</p>\n<h2>5.3 – Intrinsic Value (IV) of a Put Option</h2>\n<p>Before we proceed to generalize the behaviour of the Put Option P&amp;L, we need to understand the calculation of the intrinsic value of a Put option. We discussed the concept of intrinsic value in the previous chapter; hence I will assume you know the concept behind IV. Intrinsic Value represents the value of money the buyer will receive if he were to exercise the option upon expiry.</p>\n<p>The calculation for the intrinsic value of a Put option is slightly different from that of a call option. To help you appreciate the difference let me post here the intrinsic value formula for a Call option –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">IV (Call option) = Spot Price – Strike Price</strong></p>\n<p>The intrinsic value of a Put option is –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">IV (Put Option) = Strike Price – Spot Price</strong></p>\n<p>I want you to remember an important aspect here with respect to the intrinsic value of an option – consider the following timeline –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3_timeline-new.png\"><img alt=\"Image-3_timeline-new\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2559\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"350\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3_timeline-new.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3_timeline-new.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3_timeline-new-300x131.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The formula to calculate the intrinsic value of an option that we have just looked at is applicable <strong>only on the day of the expiry</strong>.  However, the calculation of the intrinsic value of an option is different <strong>during the series</strong>. Of course, we will understand how to calculate (and the need to calculate) the intrinsic value of an option during the expiry. But for now, we only need to know the calculation of the intrinsic value upon expiry.</p>\n<h2>5.4 – P&amp;L behaviour of the Put Option buyer</h2>\n<p>Keeping the concept of intrinsic value of a put option at the back of our mind, let us work towards building a table which would help us identify how much money, I as the buyer of  Bank Nifty’s 18400 put option would make under the various possible spot value changes of Bank Nifty (in the spot market) on expiry. Do remember the premium paid for this option is Rs 315/–. Irrespective of how the spot value changes, the fact that I have paid Rs.315/- will remain unchanged. This is the cost that I have incurred in order to buy the Bank Nifty 18400 Put Option. Let us keep this in perspective and work out the P&amp;L table –</p>\n<p><em>Please note – the negative sign before the premium paid represents a cash out flow from my trading account. </em></p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Serial No.</th>\n<th>Possible values of spot</th>\n<th>Premium Paid</th>\n<th>Intrinsic Value (IV)</th>\n<th>P&amp;L (IV + Premium)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td>16195</td>\n<td>-315</td>\n<td>18400 – 16195 = 2205</td>\n<td>2205 + (-315) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 1890</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td>16510</td>\n<td>-315</td>\n<td>18400 – 16510 = 1890</td>\n<td>1890 + (-315)= <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 1575</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td>16825</td>\n<td>-315</td>\n<td>18400 – 16825 = 1575</td>\n<td>1575 + (-315) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 1260</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td>17140</td>\n<td>-315</td>\n<td>18400 – 17140 = 1260</td>\n<td>1260 + (-315) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 945</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td>17455</td>\n<td>-315</td>\n<td>18400 – 17455 = 945</td>\n<td>945 + (-315) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 630</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td>17770</td>\n<td>-315</td>\n<td>18400 – 17770 = 630</td>\n<td>630 + (-315) = <span style=\"color: green;\">+ 315</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td>18085</td>\n<td>-315</td>\n<td>18400 – 18085 = 315</td>\n<td>315 + (-315) = 0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td>18400</td>\n<td>-315</td>\n<td>18400 – 18400 = 0</td>\n<td>0 + (-315)= <span style=\"color: red;\">– 315</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td>18715</td>\n<td>-315</td>\n<td>18400 – 18715 = 0</td>\n<td>0 + (-315) = <span style=\"color: red;\">-315</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>19030</td>\n<td>-315</td>\n<td>18400 – 19030 = 0</td>\n<td>0 + (-315) = <span style=\"color: red;\">-315</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>19345</td>\n<td>-315</td>\n<td>18400 – 19345 = 0</td>\n<td>0 + (-315) = <span style=\"color: red;\">-315</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>19660</td>\n<td>-315</td>\n<td>18400 – 19660 = 0</td>\n<td>0 + (-315) = <span style=\"color: red;\">-315</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Let us make some observations on the behaviour of the P&amp;L (and also make a few P&amp;L generalizations). For the above discussion, set your eyes at row number 8 as your reference point –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The objective behind buying a put option is to benefit from a falling price. As we can see, the profit increases as and when the price decreases in the spot market (with reference to the strike price of 18400).\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><strong>Generalization 1</strong> – Buyers of Put Options are profitable as and when the spot price goes below the strike price. In other words, buy a put option only when you are bearish about the underlying</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>As the spot price goes above the strike price (18400) the position starts to make a loss. However, the loss is restricted to the extent of the premium paid, which in this case is Rs.315/-\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Generalization 2 – A put option buyer experiences a loss when the spot price goes higher than the strike price. However, the maximum loss is <strong>restricted</strong> to the extent of the premium the put option buyer has paid.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is a general formula using which you can calculate the P&amp;L from a Put Option position. Do bear in mind this formula is applicable on positions held till expiry.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">P&amp;L = [Max (0, Strike Price – Spot Price)] – Premium Paid</strong></p>\n<p>Let us pick 2 random values and evaluate if the formula works –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>16510</li>\n<li>19660</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">@16510</strong> (spot below strike, position has to be profitable)</p>\n<p>= Max (0, 18400 -16510)] – 315</p>\n<p>= 1890 – 315</p>\n<p><strong>= + 1575</strong></p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">@19660</strong> (spot above strike, position has to be loss making, restricted to premium paid)</p>\n<p>= Max (0, 18400 – 19660) – 315</p>\n<p>= Max (0, -1260) – 315</p>\n<p><strong>= – 315</strong></p>\n<p>Clearly both the results match the expected outcome.</p>\n<p>Further, we need to understand the breakeven point calculation for a Put Option buyer. Note, I will take the liberty of skipping the explanation of a breakeven point as we have already dealt with it in the previous chapter; hence I will give you the formula to calculate the same –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">Breakeven point = Strike Price – Premium Paid</strong></p>\n<p>For the Bank Nifty breakeven point would be</p>\n<p>= 18400 – 315</p>\n<p>= 18085</p>\n<p>So as per this definition of the breakeven point, at 18085 the put option should neither make any money nor lose any money. To validate this let us apply the P&amp;L formula –</p>\n<p>= Max (0, 18400 – 18085) – 315</p>\n<p>= Max (0, 315) – 315</p>\n<p>= 315 – 315</p>\n<p>=<strong>0</strong></p>\n<p>The result obtained is clearly in line with the expectation of the breakeven point.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">Important note</strong> – The calculation of the intrinsic value, P&amp;L, and Breakeven point is all with respect to the expiry. So far in this module, we have assumed that you as an option buyer or seller would set up the option trade with an intention to hold the same till expiry.</p>\n<p>But soon you will realize that more often than not, you will initiate an options trade only to close it much earlier than expiry. Under such a situation the calculations of breakeven point may not matter much, however, the calculation of the P&amp;L and intrinsic value does matter and there is a different formula to do the same.</p>\n<p>To put this more clearly let me assume two situations on the Bank Nifty Trade, we know the trade has been initiated on 7<sup>th</sup> April 2015 and the expiry is on 30<sup>th</sup> April 2015–</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What would be the P&amp;L assuming the spot is at 17000 on 30<sup>th</sup> April 2015?</li>\n<li>What would be the P&amp;L assuming the spot is at 17000 on 15<sup>th</sup> April 2015 (or for that matter any other date apart from the expiry date)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Answer to the first question is fairly simple, we can straightway apply the P&amp;L formula –</p>\n<p>= Max (0, 18400 – 17000) – 315</p>\n<p>= Max (0, 1400) – 315</p>\n<p>= 1400 – 315</p>\n<p><strong>= 1085</strong></p>\n<p>Going on to the 2<sup>nd</sup> question, if the spot is at 17000 on any other date apart from the expiry date, the P&amp;L is <strong>not</strong> going to be 1085, it will be <strong>higher</strong>. We will discuss why this will be higher at an appropriate stage, but for now just keep this point in the back of your mind.</p>\n<h2>5.5 – Put option buyer’s P&amp;L payoff</h2>\n<p>If we connect the P&amp;L points of the Put Option and develop a line chart, we should be able to observe the generalizations we have made on the Put option buyers P&amp;L.

You can observe that at the breakeven point, the P&amp;L graph just recovers from a loss-making situation to a neutral situation. It is only above this point the put option buyer would start to make money.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy a Put Option when you are bearish about the prospects of the underlying.

They have a diametrically opposite view on markets. Going by this, if the Put option buyer is bearish about the market, then clearly the put option seller must have a bullish view on the markets. Recollect we looked at the Bank Nifty’s chart in the previous chapter; we will review the same chart again, but from the perspective of a put option seller.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-1_-Bank-Nifty1.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_ Bank Nifty\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1898\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"474\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-1_-Bank-Nifty1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-1_-Bank-Nifty1.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-1_-Bank-Nifty1-300x178.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The typical thought process for the Put Option Seller would be something like this –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bank Nifty is trading at 18417</li>\n<li>2 days ago Bank Nifty tested its resistance level at 18550 (resistance level is highlighted by a green horizontal line)</li>\n<li>18550 is considered as resistance as there is a price action zone at this level which is well spaced in time (for people who are not familiar with the concept of resistance I would suggest you read about it <strong><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/support-resistance/\">here</a></strong>)</li>\n<li>I have highlighted the price action zone in a blue rectangular boxes</li>\n<li>Bank Nifty has attempted to crack the resistance level for the last 3 consecutive times</li>\n<li>All it needs is 1 good push (maybe a large sized bank announcing decent results – HDFC, ICICI, and SBI are expected to declare results soon)</li>\n<li>A positive cue plus a move above the resistance will set Bank Nifty on the upward trajectory</li>\n<li>Hence writing the Put Option and collecting the premiums may sound like a good idea</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may have a question at this stage – If the outlook is bullish, why write (sell) a put option and why not just buy a call option?</p>\n<p>Well, the decision to either buy a call option or sell a put option really depends on how attractive the premiums are. At the time of taking the decision, if the call option has a low premium then buying a call option makes sense, likewise if the put option is trading at a very high premium then selling the put option (and therefore collecting the premium) makes sense. Of course to figure out  what exactly to do (buying a call option or selling a put option) depends on the attractiveness of the premium, and to judge how attractive the premium is you need some background knowledge on ‘option pricing’. Of course, going forward in this module we will understand option pricing.</p>\n<p>So, with these thoughts assume the trader decides to write (sell) the 18400 Put option and collect Rs.315 as the premium.  As usual let us observe the P&amp;L behavior for a Put Option seller and make a few generalizations.</p>\n<p>Do Note – when you write options (regardless of Calls or Puts) margins are blocked in your account.

The generalizations are as below (make sure you set your eyes on row 8 as it’s the strike price for this trade) –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The objective behind selling a put option is to collect the premiums and benefit from the bullish outlook on market. Therefore as we can see, the profit stays flat at Rs.315 (premium collected) as long as the spot price stays above the strike price.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><strong>Generalization 1</strong> – Sellers of the Put Options are profitable as long as long as the spot price remains at or higher than the strike price. In other words sell a put option only when you are bullish about the underlying or when you believe that the underlying will no longer continue to fall.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>As the spot price goes below the strike price (18400) the position starts to make a loss. Clearly there is no cap on how much loss the seller can experience here and it can be theoretically be unlimited\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><strong>Generalization 2</strong> – A put option seller can potentially experience an unlimited loss as and when the spot price goes lower than the strike price.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is a general formula using which you can calculate the P&amp;L from writing a Put Option position. Do bear in mind this formula is applicable on positions held till expiry.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">P&amp;L = Premium Recieved – [Max (0, Strike Price – Spot Price)] </strong></p>\n<p>Let us pick 2 random values and evaluate if the formula works –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>16510</li>\n<li>19660</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">@16510</strong> (spot below strike, position has to be loss making)</p>\n<p>= 315 – Max (0, 18400 -16510)</p>\n<p>= 315 – 1890</p>\n<p><strong>= – 1575</strong></p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">@19660</strong> (spot above strike, position has to be profitable, restricted to premium paid)</p>\n<p>= 315 – Max (0, 18400 – 19660)</p>\n<p>= 315 – Max (0, -1260)</p>\n<p><strong>=  315</strong></p>\n<p>Clearly both the results match the expected outcome.</p>\n<p>Further, the breakdown point for a Put Option seller can be defined as a point where the Put Option seller starts making a loss after giving away all the premium he has collected –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">Breakdown point = Strike Price – Premium Received</strong></p>\n<p>For the Bank Nifty, the breakdown point would be</p>\n<p>= 18400 – 315</p>\n<p>= 18085</p>\n<p>So as per this definition of the breakdown point, at 18085 the put option seller should neither make any money nor lose any money. Do note this also means at this stage, he would lose the entire Premium he has collected. To validate this, let us apply the P&amp;L formula and calculate the P&amp;L at the breakdown point –</p>\n<p>= 315 – Max (0, 18400 – 18085)</p>\n<p>= 315 – Max (0, 315)</p>\n<p>= 315 – 315</p>\n<p>=<strong>0</strong></p>\n<p>The result obtained is clearly in line with the expectation of the breakdown point.</p>\n<h2>6.3 – Put option seller’s Payoff</h2>\n<p>If we connect the P&amp;L points (as seen in the table earlier) and develop a line chart, we should be able to observe the generalizations we have made on the Put option seller’s P&amp;L. Please find below the same –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3_Payoff.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_Payoff\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1900\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"327\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3_Payoff.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3_Payoff.png 524w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Image-3_Payoff-300x187.png 300w\" width=\"524\"/></a></p>\n<p>Here are a few things that you should appreciate from the chart above, remember 18400 is the strike price –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Put option seller experiences a loss only when the spot price goes below the strike price (18400 and lower)</li>\n<li>The loss is theoretically unlimited (therefore the risk)</li>\n<li>The Put Option seller will experience a profit (to the extent of premium received) as and when the spot price trades above the strike price</li>\n<li>The gains are restricted to the extent of premium received</li>\n<li>At the breakdown point (18085) the put option seller neither makes money nor losses money. However at this stage he gives up the entire premium he has received.</li>\n<li>You can observe that at the breakdown point, the P&amp;L graph just starts to buckle down – from a positive territory to the neutral (no profit no loss) situation. It is only below this point the put option seller starts to lose money.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And with these points, hopefully you should have got the essence of Put Option selling. Over the last few chapters we have looked at both the call option and the put option from both the buyer and sellers perspective. In the next chapter we will quickly summarize the same and shift gear towards other essential concepts of Options.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>You sell a Put option when you are bullish on a stock or when you believe the stock price will no longer go down</li>\n<li>When you are bullish on the underlying you can either buy the call option or sell a put option.

Further, we looked at four different variants originating from these 2 options –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buying a Call Option</li>\n<li>Selling a Call Option</li>\n<li>Buying a Put Option</li>\n<li>Selling a Put Option</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With these 4 variants, a trader can create numerous different combinations and venture into some really efficient strategies, generally referred to as ‘Option Strategies’. Think of it this way – if you give a good artist a colour palette and canvas he can create some fascinating paintings, similarly a good trader can use these four option variants to create some outstanding trades. Imagination and intellect is the only requirement for creating these option trades. Hence before we get deeper into options, it is important to have a strong foundation on these four variants of options. For this reason, we will quickly summarize what we have learnt so far in this module.</p>\n<p>Please find below the pay off diagrams for the four different option variants –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image1_Payoff.png\"><img alt=\"Image1_Payoff\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1920\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"550\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image1_Payoff.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image1_Payoff.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image1_Payoff-300x206.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Arranging the Payoff diagrams in the above fashion helps us understand a few things better. Let me list them for you –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Let us start from the left side – if you notice we have stacked the pay off diagram of Call Option (buy) and Call option (sell) one below the other. If you look at the payoff diagram carefully, they both look like a mirror image. The mirror image of the payoff emphasis the fact that the risk-reward characteristics of an option buyer and seller are opposite. The maximum loss of the call option buyer is the maximum profit of the call option seller. Likewise, the call option buyer has unlimited profit potential, mirroring this the call option seller has maximum loss potential.</li>\n<li>We have placed the payoff of Call Option (buy) and Put Option (sell) next to each other. This is to emphasize that both these option variants make money only when the market is expected to go higher. In other words, do not buy a call option or do not sell a put option when you sense there is a chance for the markets to go down. You will not make money doing so, or in other words, you will certainly lose money in such circumstances. Of course, there is an angle of volatility here which we have not discussed yet; we will discuss the same going forward. The reason why I’m talking about volatility is that volatility has an impact on option premiums.</li>\n<li>Finally, on the right, the pay off diagram of Put Option (sell) and the Put Option (buy) are stacked one below the other. Clearly, the pay off diagrams looks like the mirror image of one another. The mirror image of the payoff emphasizes the fact that the maximum loss of the put option buyer is the maximum profit of the put option seller. Likewise, the put option buyer has unlimited profit potential, mirroring this the put option seller has maximum loss potential.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Further, here is a table where the option positions are summarized.</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Your Market View</th>\n<th>Option Type</th>\n<th>Position also called</th>\n<th>Other Alternatives</th>\n<th>Premium</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bullish</td>\n<td>Call Option (Buy)</td>\n<td>Long Call</td>\n<td>Buy Futures or Buy Spot</td>\n<td>Pay</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flat or Bullish</td>\n<td>Put Option (Sell)</td>\n<td>Short Put</td>\n<td>Buy Futures or Buy Spot</td>\n<td>Receive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Flat or Bearish</td>\n<td>Call Option (Sell)</td>\n<td>Short Call</td>\n<td>Sell Futures</td>\n<td>Receive</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bearish</td>\n<td>Put Option (Buy)</td>\n<td>Long Put</td>\n<td>Sell Futures</td>\n<td>Pay</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>It would help if you remembered that when you buy an option, it is also called a ‘Long’ position. Going by that, buying a call option and buying a put option is called Long Call and Long Put position respectively.</p>\n<p>Likewise, whenever you sell an option, it is called a ‘Short’ position. Going by that, selling a call option and selling a put option is also called Short Call and Short Put position respectively.</p>\n<p>Now here is another important thing to note, you can buy an option under 2 circumstances –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You buy to create a fresh option position.</li>\n<li>You buy intending to close an existing short position.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The position is called ‘Long Option’ only if you are creating a fresh buy position. If you are buying with and intention of closing an existing short position, then it is merely called a ‘square off’ position.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you can sell an option under 2 circumstances –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You sell intending to create a fresh short position.</li>\n<li>You sell intending to close an existing long position.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The position is called ‘Short Option’ only if you are creating a fresh sell (writing an option) position. If you are selling with and intention of closing an existing long position, then it is merely called a ‘square off’ position.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch7-title1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1921\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"250\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch7-title1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch7-title1.png 350w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch7-title1-300x214.png 300w\" width=\"350\"/></p>\n<h2>7.2 – Option Buyer in a nutshell</h2>\n<p>By now, I’m certain you would have a basic understanding of the call and put option both from the buyer’s and seller’s perspective. However, I think it is best to reiterate a few key points before we make further progress in this module.</p>\n<p>Buying an option (call or put) makes sense only when we expect the market to move strongly in a certain direction. If fact, for the option buyer to be profitable, the market should move away from the selected strike price. Selecting the right strike price to trade is a major task; we will learn this at a later stage. For now, here are a few key points that you should remember –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>P&amp;L (Long call) upon expiry is calculated as <em>P&amp;L = Max [0, (Spot Price – Strike Price)] – Premium Paid</em></li>\n<li>P&amp;L (Long Put) upon expiry is calculated as <em>P&amp;L = [Max (0, Strike Price – Spot Price)] – Premium Paid</em></li>\n<li>The above formula is applicable only when the trader intends to hold the long option till expiry</li>\n<li>The intrinsic value calculation we have looked at in the previous chapters is only applicable on the expiry day. We CANNOT use the same formula during the series</li>\n<li>The P&amp;L calculation changes when the trader intends to square off the position well before the expiry</li>\n<li>The buyer of an option has limited risk, to the extent of the premium paid. However, he enjoys an unlimited profit potential</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch7-title2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1922\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"250\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch7-title2.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch7-title2.png 350w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch7-title2-300x214.png 300w\" width=\"350\"/></p>\n<h2>7.2 – Option seller in a nutshell</h2>\n<p>The option sellers (call or put) are also called the option writers. The buyers and sellers have the exact opposite P&amp;L experience. Selling an option makes sense when you expect the market to remain flat or below the strike price (in case of calls) or above strike price (in case of put option).</p>\n<p>I want you to appreciate the fact that all else equal, markets are slightly favourable to option sellers. This is because, for the option sellers to be profitable the market has to be either flat or move in a certain direction (based on the type of option). However for the option buyer to be profitable, the market has to move in a certain direction. Clearly there are two favorable market conditions for the option seller versus one favorable condition for the option buyer. But of course, this in itself should not be a reason to sell options.</p>\n<p>Here are a few key points you need to remember when it comes to selling options –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>P&amp;L for a short call option upon expiry is calculated as <em>P&amp;L = Premium Received – Max [0, (Spot Price – Strike Price)]</em></li>\n<li>P&amp;L for a short put option upon expiry is calculated as <em>P&amp;L = Premium Received – Max (0, Strike Price – Spot Price)</em></li>\n<li>Of course the P&amp;L formula is applicable only if the trader intends to hold the position till expiry</li>\n<li>When you write options, margins are blocked in your trading account</li>\n<li>The seller of the option has unlimited risk but minimal profit potential (to the extent of the premium received)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Perhaps this is the reason why Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book “Fooled by Randomness” says “Option writers eat like a chicken but shit like an elephant”. This means to say that the option writers earn small and steady returns by selling options, but when a disaster happens, they tend to lose a fortune.</p>\n<p>Well, with this I hope you have developed a strong foundation on how a Call and Put option behaves. To give you a heads up, the focus going forward in this module will be on moneyness of an option, premiums, option pricing, option Greeks, and strike selection.  Once we understand these topics, we will revisit the call and put option all over again. When we do so, I’m certain you will see the calls and puts in a new light and perhaps develop a vision to trade options professionally.</p>\n<h2>7.3 – A quick note on Premiums</h2>\n<p>Have a look at the snapshot below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-2_BHEL.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_BHEL\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1918\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"474\" sizes=\"(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-2_BHEL.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-2_BHEL.png 575w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-2_BHEL-300x247.png 300w\" width=\"575\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is the snapshot of how the premium has behaved on an intraday basis (30<sup>th</sup> April 2015) for BHEL. The strike under consideration is 230, and the option type is a European Call Option (CE). This information is highlighted in the red box. Below the red box, I have highlighted the price information of the premium. If you notice, the premium of the 230 CE opened at Rs.2.25, shot up to make a high of Rs.8/- and closed the day at Rs.4.05/-.</p>\n<p>Think about it; the premium has gyrated over 350% intraday! i.e. from Rs.2.25/- to Rs.8/-, and it roughly closed up 180%  for the day, i.e. from Rs.2.25/- to Rs.4.05/-. Moves like this should not surprise you. These are fairly common to expect in the options world.</p>\n<p>Assume in this massive swing you managed to capture just 2 points while trading this particular option intraday. This translates to a sweet Rs.2000/- in profits considering the lot size is 1000 (highlighted in green arrow). In fact this is exactly what happens in the real world. Traders trade premiums. Hardly any traders hold option contracts until expiry. Most of the traders are interested in initiating a trade now and squaring it off in a short while (intraday or maybe for a few days) and capturing the movements in the premium. They do not really wait for the options to expire.</p>\n<p>In fact, you might be interested to know that a return of 100% or so while trading options is not really a thing of surprise. But please don’t just get carried away with what I just said; to enjoy such returns consistently you need to develop a deep insight into options.</p>\n<p>Have a look at this snapshot –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-3_Idea-option-chain.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_Idea option chain\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1919\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"473\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-3_Idea-option-chain.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-3_Idea-option-chain.png 572w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-3_Idea-option-chain-300x248.png 300w\" width=\"572\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is the option contract of IDEA Cellular Limited, strike price is 190, expiry is on 30<sup>th</sup> April 2015 and the option type is a European Call Option . These details are marked in the blue box. Below this we can notice the OHLC data, which quite obviously is very interesting.</p>\n<p>The 190CE premium opened the day at Rs.8.25/- and made a low of Rs.0.30/-. I will skip the % calculation simply because it is a ridiculous figure for intraday. However assume you were a seller of the 190 call option intraday and you managed to capture just 2 points again, considering the lot size is 2000, the 2 point capture on the premium translates to Rs.4000/- in profits intraday, good enough for that nice dinner at Marriot with your better half J.</p>\n<p>The point that I’m trying to make is that, traders (most of them) trade options only to capture the variations in premium. They don’t really bother to hold till expiry. However by no means I am suggesting that you need not hold until expiry, in fact I do hold options till expiry in certain cases. Generally, speaking option sellers tend to hold contracts till expiry rather than option buyers. This is because if you have written an option for Rs.8/- you will enjoy the full premium received, i.e. Rs.8/- only on expiry.</p>\n<p>So having said that the traders prefer to trade just the premiums, you may have a few fundamental questions cropping up in your mind. Why do premiums vary? What is the basis for the change in premium? How can I predict the change in premiums? Who decides what should be the premium price of a particular option?</p>\n<p>Well, these questions and therefore, the answers to these form the crux of option trading. If you can master these aspects of an option, let me assure you that you would set yourself on a  professional path to trade options.</p>\n<p>To give you a heads up – the answers to all these questions lies in understanding the 4 forces that simultaneously exerts its influence on options premiums, as a result of which the premiums vary. Think of this as a ship sailing in the sea. The speed at which the ship sails (assume its equivalent to the option premium) depends on various forces such as wind speed, sea water density, sea pressure, and the power of the ship. Some forces tend to increase the speed of the ship, while some tend to decrease the speed of the ship. The ship battles these forces and finally arrives at an optimal sailing speed.</p>\n<p>Likewise the premium of the option depends on certain forces called as the ‘Option Greeks’. Crudely put, some Option Greeks tends to increase the premium, while some try to reduce the premium. A formula called the ‘Black &amp; Scholes Option Pricing Formula’ employs these forces and translates the forces into a number, which is the premium of the option.</p>\n<p>Try and imagine this – the Option Greeks influence the option premium; however, the Option Greeks itself are controlled by the markets.

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>8.1 – Intrinsic Value</h2>\n<p>The moneyness of an option contract is a classification method wherein each option (strike) gets classified as either – In the money (ITM), At the money (ATM), or Out of the money (OTM) option. This classification helps the trader to decide which strike to trade, given a particular circumstance in the market. However, before we get into the details, I guess it makes sense to look through the concept of intrinsic value again.</p>\n<p>The intrinsic value of an option is the money the option buyer makes from an options contract provided he has the right to exercise that option on the given day. Intrinsic Value is always a positive value and can never go below 0. Consider this example –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Underlying</th>\n<th>CNX Nifty</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spot Value</td>\n<td>8070</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Option strike</td>\n<td>8050</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Option Type</td>\n<td>Call Option (CE)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Days to expiry</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Position</td>\n<td>Long</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Given this, assume you bought the 8050CE and instead of waiting for 15 days to expiry you had the right to exercise the option today.  Now my question to you is – How much money would you stand to make provided you exercised the contract today?</p>\n<p>Do you remember when you exercise a long option, the money you make is equivalent to the intrinsic value of an option minus the premium paid. Hence to answer the above question, we need to calculate the intrinsic value of an option, for which we need to pull up the call option intrinsic value formula from Chapter 3.</p>\n<p>Here is the formula –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">Intrinsic Value of a Call option = Spot Price – Strike Price</strong></p>\n<p>Let us plug in the values</p>\n<p>= 8070 – 8050</p>\n<p>= 20</p>\n<p>So, if you were to exercise this option today, you are entitled to make 20 points (ignoring the premium paid).</p>\n<p>Here is a table which calculates the intrinsic value for various options strike (these are just random values that I have used to drive across the concept) –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Option Type</th>\n<th>Strike</th>\n<th>Spot</th>\n<th>Formula</th>\n<th>Intrinsic Value</th>\n<th>Remarks</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Long Call</td>\n<td>280</td>\n<td>310</td>\n<td>Spot Price – Strike Price</td>\n<td>310 – 280 = 30</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Long Put</td>\n<td>1040</td>\n<td>980</td>\n<td>Strike Price – Spot Price</td>\n<td>1040 -980 = 60</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Long Call</td>\n<td>920</td>\n<td>918</td>\n<td>Spot Price – Strike Price</td>\n<td>918 – 920 = 0</td>\n<td>Since IV cannot be -ve</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Long Put</td>\n<td>80</td>\n<td>88</td>\n<td>Strike Price – Spot Price</td>\n<td>80 – 88 = 0</td>\n<td>Since IV cannot be -ve</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>With this, I hope you are clear about the intrinsic value calculation for a given option strike. Let me summarize a few important points –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The intrinsic value of an option is the amount of money you would make if you were to exercise the option contract</li>\n<li>The intrinsic value of an options contract can never be negative. It can be either zero or a positive number</li>\n<li>Call option Intrinsic value = Spot Price – Strike Price</li>\n<li>Put option Intrinsic value = Strike Price – Spot price</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before we wrap up this discussion, here is a question for you – Why do you think the intrinsic value cannot be negative?</p>\n<p>To answer this, let us pick an example from the above table – Strike is 920, the spot is 918, and option type is a long call. Let us assume the premium for the 920 Call option is Rs.15.</p>\n<p>Now,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you were to exercise this option, what do you get?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Clearly, we get the intrinsic value.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>How much is the intrinsic value?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Intrinsic Value = 918 – 920 = <strong>-2</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The formula suggests we get ‘<strong>– Rs.2</strong>’. What does this mean?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>This means Rs.2 is going from our pocket.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Let us believe this is true for a moment; what will be the total loss?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>15 + 2 = Rs.17/-</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>But we know the maximum loss for a call option buyer is limited to the extent of the premium one pays; in this case, it will be Rs.15/-\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>However, if we include a negative intrinsic value, this property of option payoff is not obeyed (Rs.17/- loss as opposed to Rs.15/-). However, to maintain the non-linear property of option payoff, the Intrinsic value can never be negative</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>You can apply the same logic to the put option intrinsic value calculation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hopefully, this should give you some insights into why the intrinsic value of an option can never go negative.</p>\n<h2>8.2 – Moneyness of a Call option</h2>\n<p>With our discussions on the intrinsic value of an option, the concept of moneyness should be quite easy to comprehend. Moneyness of an option is a classification method that classifies each option strike based on how much money a trader will make if he were to exercise his option contract today. There are three broad classifications –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the Money (ITM)</li>\n<li>At the Money (ATM)</li>\n<li>Out of the Money (OTM)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And for all practical purposes, I guess it is best to further classify these as –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deep In the money</li>\n<li>In the Money (ITM)</li>\n<li>At the Money (ATM)</li>\n<li>Out of the Money (OTM)</li>\n<li>Deep Out of the Money</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Understanding these options, strike classification is very easy. All you need to do is figure out the intrinsic value. If the intrinsic value is a non zero number, then the option strike is considered ‘In the money’. If the intrinsic value is a zero the option strike is called ‘Out of the money’. The strike, which is closest to the Spot price, is called ‘At the money’.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch8-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1945\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch8-title.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch8-title.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch8-title-300x150.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>Let us take up an example to understand this well. As of today (7<sup>th</sup> May 2015) the value of Nifty is at 8060, keeping this in perspective I’ve taken the snapshot of all the available strike prices (the same is highlighted within a blue box). The objective is to classify each of these strikes as ITM, ATM, or OTM. We will discuss the ‘Deep ITM’ and ‘Deep OTM’ later.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-1-_Call-Option.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1 _Call Option\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1941 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"595\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-1-_Call-Option.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-1-_Call-Option.png 493w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-1-_Call-Option-249x300.png 249w\" width=\"493\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can notice from the image above, the available strike prices trade starts from 7100 all the way upto 8700.</p>\n<p>We will first identify ‘At<strong> the Money Option (ATM)</strong>’ as this is the easiest to deal with.</p>\n<p>From the definition of ATM option that we posted earlier, we know, ATM option is that option strike which is closest to the spot price. Considering the spot is at 8060, the closest strike is probably 8050. If there were an 8060 strike, then clearly 8060 would be the ATM option. But in the absence of 8060 strikes, the next closest strike becomes ATM. Hence we classify 8050 as, the ATM option.</p>\n<p>Having established the ATM option (8050), we will proceed to identify ITM and OTM options. To do this, we will pick a few strikes and calculate the intrinsic value.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>7100</li>\n<li>7500</li>\n<li>8050</li>\n<li>8100</li>\n<li>8300</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do remember the spot price is 8060, keeping this in perspective the intrinsic value for the strikes above would be –</p>\n<p><strong>@ 7100 </strong></p>\n<p>Intrinsic Value = 8060 – 7100</p>\n<p>= 960</p>\n<p>Non zero value, hence the strike should be In the Money (ITM) option</p>\n<p><strong>@7500</strong></p>\n<p>Intrinsic Value = 8060 – 7500</p>\n<p>= 560</p>\n<p>Non zero value, hence the strike should be In the Money (ITM) option</p>\n<p><strong>@8050</strong></p>\n<p>We know this is the ATM option as 8050 strike is closest to the spot price of 8060. So we will not bother to calculate its intrinsic value.</p>\n<p><strong>@ 8100 </strong></p>\n<p>Intrinsic Value = 8060 – 8100</p>\n<p>= – 40</p>\n<p>Negative intrinsic value, therefore the intrinsic value is 0. Since the intrinsic value is 0, the strike is Out of the Money (OTM).</p>\n<p><strong>@ 8300 </strong></p>\n<p>Intrinsic Value = 8060 – 8300</p>\n<p>= – 240</p>\n<p>Negative intrinsic value, therefore the intrinsic value is 0. Since the intrinsic value is 0, the strike is Out of the Money (OTM).</p>\n<p>You may have already sensed the generalizations (for call options) that exists here, however, allow me to restate the same again</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All option strikes that are higher than the ATM strike are considered OTM</li>\n<li>All option strikes that are below the ATM strike are considered ITM</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In fact, I would suggest you relook at the snapshot we just posted –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-2-_Call-Option-again.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2 _Call Option again\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1942\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"595\" sizes=\"(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-2-_Call-Option-again.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-2-_Call-Option-again.png 493w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-2-_Call-Option-again-249x300.png 249w\" width=\"493\"/></a></p>\n<p>NSE presents ITM options with a pale yellow background, and all OTM options have a regular white background. Now let us look at 2 ITM options – 7500 and 8000. The intrinsic value works out to be 560 and 60, respectively (considering the spot is at 8060). Higher the intrinsic value, deeper the moneyness of the option. Therefore 7500 strikes are considered as ‘Deep In the Money’ option and 8000 as just ‘In the money’ option.</p>\n<p>I would encourage you to observe the premiums for all these strike prices (highlighted in the green box). Do you sense a pattern here? The premium decreases as you traverse from ‘Deep ITM’ option to ‘Deep OTM option’. In other words, ITM options are always more expensive compared to OTM options.</p>\n<h2>8.3 – Moneyness of a Put option</h2>\n<p>Let us run through the same exercise to find out how strikes are classified as ITM and OTM for Put options. Here is the snapshot of various strikes available for a Put option. The strike prices on the left are highlighted in a blue box. Do note at the time of taking the snapshot (8<sup>th</sup> May 2015) Nifty’s spot value is 8202.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-3_Put-Option-Strikes.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_Put Option Strikes\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1943\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"591\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-3_Put-Option-Strikes.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-3_Put-Option-Strikes.png 499w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-3_Put-Option-Strikes-253x300.png 253w\" width=\"499\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, there are many strike prices available right from 7100 to 8700. We will first classify the ATM option and then proceed to identify the ITM and OTM option. Since the spot is at 8202, the nearest strike to spot should be the ATM option. As we can see from the snapshot above, there is a strike at 8200 which is trading at Rs.131.35/-. This obviously becomes the ATM option.</p>\n<p>We will now pick a few strikes above and below the ATM and figure out ITM and OTM options. Let us go with the following strikes and evaluate their respective intrinsic value (also called the moneyness) –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>7500</li>\n<li>8000</li>\n<li>8200</li>\n<li>8300</li>\n<li>8500</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>@ 7500 </strong></p>\n<p>We know the intrinsic value of the put option can be calculated as = <strong>Strike – Spot.</strong></p>\n<p>Intrinsic Value = 7500 – 8200</p>\n<p>= – 700</p>\n<p>Negative intrinsic value, therefore the option is OTM</p>\n<p><strong>@ 8000 </strong></p>\n<p>Intrinsic Value = 8000 – 8200</p>\n<p>= – 200</p>\n<p>Negative intrinsic value, therefore the option is OTM</p>\n<p><strong>@8200</strong></p>\n<p>8200 is already classified as an ATM option. Hence we will skip this and move ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>@ 8300 </strong></p>\n<p>Intrinsic Value = 8300 – 8200</p>\n<p>= +100</p>\n<p>Positive intrinsic value, therefore the option is ITM</p>\n<p><strong>@ 8500 </strong></p>\n<p>Intrinsic Value = 8500 – 8200</p>\n<p>= +300</p>\n<p>Positive intrinsic value, therefore the option is ITM</p>\n<p>Hence, an easy generalization for Put options are –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All strikes <strong>higher than </strong>ATM options are considered ITM</li>\n<li>All strikes <strong>lower than </strong>ATM options are considered OTM</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And as you can see from the snapshot, the premiums for ITM options are much higher than the premiums for the OTM options. <strong> </strong></p>\n<p>I hope you have got a clear understanding of how option strikes are classified based on their moneyness. However, you may still be wondering about the need to classify options based on their moneyness. Well, the answer to this lies in ‘Option Greeks’ again. As you briefly know by now, Option Greeks are the market forces which act upon options strikes and therefore affect the premium associated with these strikes. So a certain market force will have a certain effect on ITM option while at the same time, it will have a different effect on an OTM option. Hence classifying the option strikes will help us in understanding the Option Greeks and their impact on the premiums better.</p>\n<h2>8.4 – The Option Chain</h2>\n<p>The Option chain is a common feature on most of the exchanges and trading platforms. The option chain is a ready reckoner of sorts that helps you identify all the strikes that are available for a particular underlying and also classifies the strikes based on their moneyness. Besides, the option chain also provides information such as the premium price (LTP), bid-ask price, volumes, open interest etc. for each of the option strikes.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the option chain of Ashoka Leyland Limited as published on NSE –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-4_Option-Chain.png\"><img alt=\"Image 4_Option Chain\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1944\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-4_Option-Chain.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-4_Option-Chain.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-4_Option-Chain-300x150.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Few observations to help you understand the option chain better –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The underlying spot value is at Rs.68.7/- (highlighted in blue)</li>\n<li>The Call options are on to the left side of the option chain</li>\n<li>The Put options are on to the right side of the option chain</li>\n<li>The strikes are stacked on an increasing order in the centre of the option chain</li>\n<li>Considering the spot at Rs.68.7, the closest strike is 67.5. Hence that would be an ATM option (highlighted in yellow)</li>\n<li>For Call options – all option strikes lower than ATM options are ITM option. Hence they have a pale yellow background</li>\n<li>For Call options – all option strikes higher than ATM options are OTM options. Hence they have a white background</li>\n<li>For Put Options – all option strikes higher than ATM are ITM options. Hence they have a pale yellow background</li>\n<li>For Put Options – all option strikes lower than ATM are OTM options. Hence they have a white background</li>\n<li>The pale yellow and white background from NSE is just a segregation method to bifurcate the ITM and OTM options. The colour scheme is not a standard convention.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is the link to check the option chain for <a href=\"http://www.nseindia.com/live_market/dynaContent/live_watch/option_chain/optionKeys.jsp?symbolCode=-10007&amp;symbol=NIFTY&amp;symbol=NIFTY&amp;instrument=-&amp;date=-&amp;segmentLink=17&amp;symbolCount=2&amp;segmentLink=17\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Nifty Options</strong>.</a></p>\n<h2>8.4 – The way forward</h2>\n<p>Having understood the basics of the call and put options both from the buyers and sellers perspective and also having understood the concept of ITM, OTM, and ATM I suppose we are all set to dwell deeper into options.</p>\n<p>The next couple of chapters will be dedicated to understanding Option Greeks and the kind of impact they have on option premiums. Based on the Option Greeks impact on the premiums, we will figure out a way to select the best possible strike to trade for a given circumstance in the market.  Further, we will also understand how options are priced by briefly running through the ‘Black &amp; Scholes Option Pricing Formula’. The ‘Black &amp; Scholes Option Pricing Formula’ will help us understand things like – Why Nifty 8200 PE is trading at 131 and not 152 or 102!</p>\n<p>I hope you are as excited to learn about all these topics as we are to write about the same.

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>9.1 – Overview</h2>\n<p>Yesterday I watched the latest bollywood flick ‘Piku’. Quite nice I must say. After watching the movie I was casually pondering over what really made me like Piku – was it the overall storyline, or Amitabh Bachchan’s brilliant acting, or Deepika Padukone’s charming screen presence, or Shoojit Sircar’s brilliant direction? Well, I suppose it was a mix of all these factors that made the movie enjoyable.</p>\n<p>This also made me realize, there is a remarkable similarity between a bollywood movie and an options trade. Similar to a bollywood movie, for an options trade to be successful in the market there are several forces which need to work in the option trader’s favor. These forces are collectively called ‘The Option Greeks’. These forces influence an option contract in real time, affecting the premium to either increase or decrease on a minute by minute basis. To make matters complicated, these forces not only influence the premiums directly but also influence each another.</p>\n<p>To put this in perspective think about these two bollywood actors – Aamir Khan and Salman Khan. Movie buffs would recognize them as two independent acting forces (similar to option Greeks) of Bollywood. They can independently influence the outcome of the movie they act in (think of the movie as an options premium). However if you put both these guys in a single flick, chances are that they will try to pull one another down while at the same time push themselves up and at the same time try to make the movie a success. Do you see the juggling around here? This may not be a perfect analogy, but I hope it gives you a sense of what I’m trying to convey.</p>\n<p>Options Premiums, options Greeks, and the natural demand supply situation of the markets influence each other. Though all these factors work as independent agents, yet they are all intervened with one another. The final outcome of this mixture can be assessed in the option’s premium. For an options trader, assessing the variation in premium is most important. He needs to develop a sense for how these factors play out before setting up an option trade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch9-Illustration1.png\"><img alt=\"M5-Ch9-Illustration1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1979\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"196\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch9-Illustration1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch9-Illustration1.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch9-Illustration1-300x98.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a> So without much ado, let me introduce the Greeks to you –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Delta</strong> – Measures the rate of change of options premium based on the directional movement of the underlying</li>\n<li><strong>Gamma</strong> – Rate of change of delta itself</li>\n<li><strong>Vega</strong> – Rate of change of premium based on change in volatility</li>\n<li><strong>Theta</strong> – Measures the impact on premium based on time left for expiry</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will discuss these Greeks over the next few chapters.

The first snapshot was taken at 09:18 AM when Nifty spot was at 8292.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-1_at-918.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_at 918\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1976\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"479\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-1_at-918.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-1_at-918.png 572w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-1_at-918-300x251.png 300w\" width=\"572\"/></a> <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-2_nifty-8316.png\"><br/>\n</a>A little while later…</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Image 2_nifty 8316\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1977\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"479\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-2_nifty-8316.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-2_nifty-8316.png 574w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-2_nifty-8316-300x250.png 300w\" width=\"574\"/></p>\n<p>Now notice the change in premium – at 09:18 AM <strong>when Nifty was at 8292 </strong>the call option was trading at 144, however at 10:00 AM <strong>Nifty moved to 8315 </strong>and the same call option was trading at 150.</p>\n<p>In fact here is another snapshot at 10:55 AM – <strong>Nifty declined to 8288</strong> and so did the option premium (declined to 133).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Image 3_nifty 8288\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1978\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"484\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-3_nifty-8288.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-3_nifty-8288.png 571w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Image-3_nifty-8288-300x254.png 300w\" width=\"571\"/></p>\n<p>From the above observations one thing stands out very clear – as and when the value of the spot changes, so does the option premium. More precisely as we already know – the call option premium increases with the increase in the spot value and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Keeping this in perspective, imagine this – you have predicted that Nifty will reach 8355 by 3:00 PM today. From the snapshots above we know that the premium will certainly change – but by how much? What is the likely value of the 8250 CE premium if Nifty reaches 8355?</p>\n<p>Well, this is exactly where the ‘Delta of an Option’ comes handy. The Delta measures how an options value changes with respect to the change in the underlying. In simpler terms, the Delta of an option helps us answer questions of this sort – “By how many points will the option premium change for every 1 point change in the underlying?”</p>\n<p>Therefore the Option Greek’s ‘Delta’ captures the effect of the directional movement of the market on the Option’s premium.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch9-Illustration2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1980\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"226\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch9-Illustration2.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch9-Illustration2.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/M5-Ch9-Illustration2-300x113.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>The delta is a number which varies –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Between 0 and 1 for a call option, some traders prefer to use the 0 to 100 scale. So the delta value of 0.55 on 0 to 1 scale is equivalent to 55 on the 0 to 100 scale.</li>\n<li>Between -1 and 0 (-100 to 0) for a put option. So the delta value of -0.4 on the -1 to 0 scale is equivalent to -40 on the -100 to 0 scale</li>\n<li>We will soon understand why the put option’s delta has a negative value associated with it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At this stage I want to give you an orientation of how this chapter will shape up, please do keep this at the back of your mind as I believe it will help you join the dots better –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We will understand how we can use the Delta value for Call Options</li>\n<li>A quick note on how the Delta values are arrived at</li>\n<li>Understand how we can use the Delta value for Put Options</li>\n<li>Delta Characteristics – Delta vs. Spot, Delta Acceleration (continued in next chapter)</li>\n<li>Option positions in terms of Delta (continued in next chapter)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So let’s hit the road!</p>\n<h2>9.3 – Delta for a Call Option</h2>\n<p>We know the delta is a number that ranges between 0 and 1. Assume a call option has a delta of 0.3 or 30 – what does this mean?</p>\n<p>Well, as we know the delta measures the rate of change of premium for every unit change in the underlying. So a delta of 0.3 indicates that for every 1 point change in the underlying, the premium is likely change by 0.3 units, or for every 100 point change in the underlying the premium is likely to change by 30 points.</p>\n<p>The following example should help you understand this better –</p>\n<p>Nifty @ 10:55 AM is at 8288</p>\n<p>Option Strike = 8250 Call Option</p>\n<p>Premium = 133</p>\n<p>Delta of the option = + 0.55</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Nifty @ 3:15 PM is expected to reach 8310</span></p>\n<p>What is the likely option premium value at 3:15 PM?</p>\n<p>Well, this is fairly easy to calculate. We know the Delta of the option is 0.55, which means for every 1 point change in the underlying the premium is expected to change by 0.55 points.</p>\n<p>We are expecting the underlying to change by 22 points (8310 – 8288), hence the premium is supposed to increase by</p>\n<p>= 22*0.55</p>\n<p><strong>= 12.1 </strong></p>\n<p>Therefore the new option premium is expected to trade around <strong>145.1</strong> (133+12.1)</p>\n<p>Which is the sum of old premium + expected change in premium</p>\n<p>Let us pick another case – what if one anticipates a drop in Nifty? What will happen to the premium? Let us figure that out –</p>\n<p>Nifty @ 10:55 AM is at 8288</p>\n<p>Option Strike = 8250 Call Option</p>\n<p>Premium = 133</p>\n<p>Delta of the option = 0.55</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Nifty @ 3:15 PM is expected to reach 8200</span></p>\n<p>What is the likely premium value at 3:15 PM?</p>\n<p>We are expecting Nifty to decline by <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 88</strong> points (8200 – 8288), hence the change in premium will be –</p>\n<p>= <span style=\"color: red;\">– 88 * 0.55</span></p>\n<p>= <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 48.4</strong></p>\n<p>Therefore the premium is expected to trade around</p>\n<p>= 133 – 48.4</p>\n<p>= 84.6<strong> </strong>(new premium value)</p>\n<p>As you can see from the above two examples, the delta helps us evaluate the premium value based on the directional move in the underlying. This is extremely useful information to have while trading options. For example assume you expect a massive 100 point up move on Nifty, and based on this expectation you decide to buy an option. There are two Call options and you need to decide which one to buy.</p>\n<p>Call Option 1 has a delta of 0.05</p>\n<p>Call Option 2 has a delta of 0.2</p>\n<p>Now the question is, which option will you buy?</p>\n<p>Let us do some math to answer this –</p>\n<p>Change in underlying = 100 points</p>\n<p>Call option 1 Delta = 0.05</p>\n<p>Change in premium for call option 1 = 100 * 0.05</p>\n<p>= 5</p>\n<p>Call option 2 Delta = 0.2</p>\n<p>Change in premium for call option 2 = 100 * 0.2</p>\n<p>= 20</p>\n<p>As you can see the same 100 point move in the underlying has different effects on different options. In this case clearly the trader would be better off buying Call Option 2. This should give you a hint – the delta helps you select the right option strike to trade. But of course there are more dimensions to this, which we will explore soon.</p>\n<p>At this stage let me post a very important question – Why is the delta value for a call option bound by 0 and 1? Why can’t the call option’s delta go beyond 0 and 1?</p>\n<p>To help understand this, let us look at 2 scenarios wherein I will purposely keep the delta value above 1 and below 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1: Delta greater than 1 for a call option</strong></p>\n<p>Nifty @ 10:55 AM at 8268</p>\n<p>Option Strike = 8250 Call Option</p>\n<p>Premium = 133</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Delta of the option = 1.5 (purposely keeping it above 1)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Nifty @ 3:15 PM is expected to reach 8310</span></p>\n<p>What is the likely premium value at 3:15 PM?</p>\n<p>Change in Nifty = 42 points</p>\n<p>Therefore the change in premium (considering the delta is 1.5)</p>\n<p>= 1.5*42</p>\n<p><strong>= 63</strong></p>\n<p>Do you notice that? The answer suggests that for a 42 point change in the underlying, the value of premium is increasing by 63 points! In other words, the option is gaining more value than the underlying itself. Remember the option is a derivative contract, it derives its value from its respective underlying, hence it can never move faster than the underlying.</p>\n<p>If the delta is 1 (which is the maximum delta value) it signifies that the option is moving in line with the underlying which is acceptable, but a value higher than 1 does not make sense.  For this reason the delta of an option is fixed to a maximum value of 1 or 100.</p>\n<p>Let us extend the same logic to figure out why the delta of a call option is lower bound to 0.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2: Delta lesser than 0 for a call option</strong></p>\n<p>Nifty @ 10:55 AM at 8288</p>\n<p>Option Strike = 8300 Call Option</p>\n<p>Premium = 9</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Delta of the option = – 0.2 (have purposely changed the value to below 0, hence negative delta)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Nifty @ 3:15 PM is expected to reach 8200</span></p>\n<p>What is the likely premium value at 3:15 PM?</p>\n<p>Change in Nifty = 88 points (8288 -8200)</p>\n<p>Therefore the change in premium (considering the delta is -0.2)</p>\n<p>= -0.2*88</p>\n<p>= <strong>-17.6</strong></p>\n<p>For a moment we will assume this is true, therefore new premium will be</p>\n<p>= -17.6 + 9</p>\n<p>= <strong>– 8.6</strong></p>\n<p>As you can see in this case, when the delta of a call option goes below 0, there is a possibility for the premium to go below 0, which is impossible. At this point do recollect the premium irrespective of a call or put can never be negative. Hence for this reason, the delta of a call option is lower bound to zero.</p>\n<h2>9.4 – Who decides the value of the Delta?</h2>\n<p>The value of the delta is one of the many outputs from the Black &amp; Scholes option pricing formula. As I have mentioned earlier in this module, the B&amp;S formula takes in a bunch of inputs and gives out a few key outputs. The output includes the option’s delta value and other Greeks. After discussing all the Greeks, we will also go through the B&amp;S formula to strengthen our understanding on options. However for now, you need to be aware that the delta and other Greeks are market driven values and are computed by the B&amp;S formula.</p>\n<p>However here is a table which will help you identify the approximate delta value for a given option –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Option Type</th>\n<th>Approx Delta value (CE)</th>\n<th>Approx Delta value (PE)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deep ITM</td>\n<td>Between + 0.8 to + 1</td>\n<td>Between – 0.8 to – 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slightly ITM</td>\n<td>Between + 0.6 to + 1</td>\n<td>Between – 0.6 to – 1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ATM</td>\n<td>Between + 0.45 to + 0.55</td>\n<td>Between – 0.45 to – 0.55</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slightly OTM</td>\n<td>Between + 0.45 to + 0.3</td>\n<td>Between – 0.45 to -0.3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deep OTM</td>\n<td>Between + 0.3 to + 0</td>\n<td>Between – 0.3 to – 0</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Of course you can always find out the exact delta of an option by using a B&amp;S option pricing calculator.</p>\n<h2>9.5 – Delta for a Put Option</h2>\n<p>Do recollect the Delta of a Put Option ranges from -1 to 0. The negative sign is just to illustrate the fact that when the underlying gains in value, the value of premium goes down. Keeping this in mind, consider the following details –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Parameters</th>\n<th>Values</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Underlying</td>\n<td>Nifty</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Strike</td>\n<td>8300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spot value</td>\n<td>8268</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Premium</td>\n<td>128</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Delta</td>\n<td>-0.55</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expected Nifty Value (Case 1)</td>\n<td>8310</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Expected Nifty Value (Case 2)</td>\n<td>8230</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Note – 8268 is a slightly ITM option, hence the delta is around -0.55 (as indicated from the table above).</p>\n<p>The objective is to evaluate the new premium value considering the delta value to be <strong>-0.55</strong>. Do pay attention to the calculations made below.</p>\n<p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Nifty is expected to move to 8310</p>\n<p>Expected change = 8310 – 8268</p>\n<p>= 42</p>\n<p>Delta = – 0.55</p>\n<p>= -0.55*42</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">= -23.1</strong></p>\n<p>Current Premium = 128</p>\n<p>New Premium = 128 -23.1</p>\n<p><strong>= 104.9</strong></p>\n<p>Here I’m subtracting the value of delta since I know that the value of a Put option declines when the underlying value increases.</p>\n<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Nifty is expected to move to 8230</p>\n<p>Expected change = 8268 – 8230</p>\n<p>= 38</p>\n<p>Delta = – 0.55</p>\n<p>= -0.55*38</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">= -20.9</strong></p>\n<p>Current Premium = 128</p>\n<p>New Premium = 128 + 20.9</p>\n<p><strong>= 148.9</strong></p>\n<p>Here I’m adding the value of delta since I know that the value of a Put option gains when the underlying value decreases.</p>\n<p>I hope with the above two Illustrations you are now clear on how to use the Put Option’s delta value to evaluate the new premium value. Also, I will take the liberty to skip explaining why the Put Option’s delta is bound between -1 and 0.</p>\n<p>In fact I would encourage the readers to apply the same logic we used while understanding why the call option’s delta is bound between 0 and 1, to understand why Put option’s delta is bound between -1 and 0.</p>\n<p>In the next chapter we will dig deeper into Delta and understand some of its characteristics.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Option Greeks are forces that influence the premium of an option</li>\n<li>Delta is an Option Greek that captures the effect of the direction of the market</li>\n<li>Call option delta varies between 0 and 1, some traders prefer to use 0 to 100.</li>\n<li>Put option delta varies between -1 and 0 (-100 to 0)</li>\n<li>The negative delta value for a Put Option indicates that the option premium and underlying value moves in the opposite direction</li>\n<li>ATM options have a delta of 0.5</li>\n<li>ITM option have a delta of close to 1</li>\n<li>OTM options have a delta of close to 0.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

Besides discussing the delta, there was another hidden agenda in the previous chapter – to set you on a ‘model thinking’ path. Let me explain what I mean by this – the previous chapter opened up a new window to evaluate options. The window threw open different option trading perspectives – hopefully, you now no longer think about options in a one-dimensional perspective.</p>\n<p>For instance, going forward if you have a view on markets (bullish for example) you <strong>may not</strong> strategize your trade this way – ‘My view is bullish, therefore it makes sense to either buy a call option or collect a premium by selling a put option’.</p>\n<p>Rather you may strategize this way – “My view is bullish as I expect the market to move by 40 points, therefore it makes sense to buy an option which has a delta of 0.5 or more as the option is expected to gain at least 20 points for the given 40 point move in the market”.</p>\n<p>See the difference between the two thought processes? While the former is a bit naïve and casual, the latter is well defined and quantitative in nature. The expectation of a 20 point move in the option premium was an outcome of a formula that we explored in the previous chapter –</p>\n<p><strong>Expected change in option premium = Option Delta * Points change in underlying</strong></p>\n<p>The above formula is just one piece in the whole game plan. As and when we discover the other Greeks, the evaluation metric becomes more quantitative and in the process, the trade selection becomes more scientifically streamlined. Point is – the thinking going forward will be guided by equations and numbers and ‘casual trading thoughts’ will have a very little scope. I know there are many traders who trade just with a few random thoughts and some may even be successful. However, this is not everybody’s cup of tea. The odds are better when you put numbers in perspective – and this happens when you develop ‘model thinking’.</p>\n<p>So please do keep model thinking framework in perspective while analyzing options, as this will help you set up systematic trades.</p>\n<h2>10.2 – Delta versus the spot price</h2>\n<p>In the previous chapter, we looked at the significance of Delta and also understood how one can use delta to evaluate the expected change in premium. Before we proceed any further, here is a quick recap from the previous chapter –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Call options have a +ve delta. A Call option with a delta of 0.4 indicates that for every 1 point gain/loss in the underlying the call option premium gains/losses 0.4 points</li>\n<li>Put options have a –ve delta. A Put option with a delta of -0.4 indicates that for every 1 point loss/gain in the underlying the put option premium gains/losses 0.4 points</li>\n<li>OTM options have a delta value between 0 and 0.5, ATM option has a delta of 0.5, and ITM option has a delta between 0.5 and 1.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let me take cues from the 3<sup>rd</sup> point here and make some deductions. Assume Nifty Spot is at 8312, strike under consideration is 8400, and option type is CE (Call option, European).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the approximate Delta value for the 8400 CE when the spot is 8312?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Delta should be between 0 and 0.5 as 8400 CE is OTM. Let us assume Delta is 0.4</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Assume Nifty spot moves from 8312 to 8400, what do you think is the Delta value?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Delta should be around 0.5 as the 8400 CE is now an ATM option</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Further assume Nifty spot moves from 8400 to 8500, what do you think is the Delta value?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Delta should be closer to 1 as the 8400 CE is now an ITM option. Let us say 0.8.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Finally assume Nifty Spot cracks heavily and drops back to 8300 from 8500, what happens to delta?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>With the fall in spot, the option has again become an OTM from ITM, hence the value of delta also falls from 0.8 to let us say 0.35.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>What can you deduce from the above 4 points?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Clearly as and when the spot value changes, the moneyness of an option changes, and therefore the delta also changes.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now this is a very important point here – <strong>the delta changes with changes in the value of spot</strong>. Hence delta is a variable and not really a fixed entity. Therefore if an option has a delta of 0.4, the value is likely to change with the change in the value of the underlying.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the chart below – it captures the movement of delta versus the spot price. The chart is a generic one and not specific to any particular option or strike as such. As you can see there are two lines –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The blue line captures the behaviour of the Call option’s delta (varies from 0 to 1)</li>\n<li>The red line captures the behavior of the Put option’s delta (varies from -1 to 0)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let us understand this better –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-1_Delta-vs-Spot1.png\"><img alt=\"Image-1_Delta-vs-Spot\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2021\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"640\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-1_Delta-vs-Spot1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-1_Delta-vs-Spot1.png 640w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-1_Delta-vs-Spot1-150x150.png 150w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-1_Delta-vs-Spot1-300x300.png 300w\" width=\"640\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is a very interesting chart, and to begin with I would suggest you look at only the blue line and ignore the red line completely. The blue line represents the delta of a call option. The graph above captures few interesting characteristics of the delta; let me list them for you (meanwhile keep this point in the back of your mind – as and when the spot price changes, the moneyness of the option also changes) –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Look at the X-axis – starting from left the moneyness increases as the spot price traverses from OTM to ATM to ITM</li>\n<li>Look at the delta line (blue line) – as and when the spot price increases so does the delta</li>\n<li>Notice at OTM the delta is flattish near 0 – this also means irrespective of how much the spot price falls ( going from OTM to deep OTM) the option’s delta will remain at 0\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Remember the call option’s delta is lower bound by 0</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>When the spot moves from OTM to ATM the delta also starts to pick up (remember the option’s moneyness also increases)\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Notice how the delta of option lies within 0 to 0.5 range for options that are less than ATM</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>At ATM, the delta hits a value of 0.5</li>\n<li>When the spot moves along from the ATM towards ITM the delta starts to move beyond the 0.5 mark</li>\n<li>Notice the delta starts to fatten out when it hits a value of 1\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>This also implies that as and when the delta moves beyond ITM to say deep ITM the delta value does not change. It stays at its maximum value of 1.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can notice similar characteristics for the Put Option’s delta (red line).</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch10-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2008\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"223\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M5-Ch10-title.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M5-Ch10-title.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M5-Ch10-title-300x112.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>10.3 – The Delta Acceleration</h2>\n<p>If you are fairly involved in the options world you may have heard of bizarre stories of how traders double or triple their money by trading OTM option. If you have not heard such stories, let me tell you one – It was 17<sup>th</sup> May 2009 (Sunday), the election results were declared, the UPA Government got re-elected at the center and Dr.Manmohan Singh came back as the country’s Prime Minister to serve his 2<sup>nd</sup> term. Stock markets likes stability at the center and we all knew that the market would rally the next day i.e. 18<sup>th</sup> May 2009. The previous day Nifty had closed at 3671.</p>\n<p>Zerodha was not born then, we were just a bunch of traders trading our own capital along with a few clients. One of our associates had taken a huge risk few days prior to 17<sup>th</sup> May – he bought far off options (OTM) worth Rs.200,000/-. A dare devil act this was considering the fact that nobody can really predict the outcome of a general election. Obviously he would benefit if the market rallied, but for the market to rally there were many factors at play. Along with him, we too were very anxious to figure out what would happen. Finally the results were declared and we all knew he would make money on 18<sup>th</sup> May – but none of us really knew to what extent he would stand to benefit.</p>\n<p>18<sup>th</sup> May 2009, a day that I cannot forget – markets opened at 9:55 AM (that was the market opening time back then), it was a big bang open for market, Nifty immediately hit an upper circuit and the markets froze. Within a matter of few minutes Nifty rallied close to 20% to close the day at 4321! The exchanges decided to close the market at 10:01 AM as it was overheated…and thus it was the shortest working day of my life.</p>\n<p>Here is the chart that highlights that day’s market move –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-3_Story.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_Story\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2007\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"476\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-3_Story.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-3_Story.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-3_Story-300x179.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>In the whole process our dear associate had made a sweet fortune. At 10:01 AM on that glorious Monday morning, his option were valued at Rs.28,00,000/-  a whopping 1300% gain all achieved overnight! This is the kind of trades that almost all traders including me aspire to experience.</p>\n<p>Anyway, let me ask you a few questions regarding this story and that will also bring us back to the main topic –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why do you think our associate choose to buy OTM options and not really ATM or ITM options?</li>\n<li>What would have happened if he had bought an ITM or ATM option instead?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Well, the answers to these questions lie in this graph –</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Image 2_Delta accelaration\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2017\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"480\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-2_Delta-accelaration-1024x614.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-2_Delta-accelaration-1024x614.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-2_Delta-accelaration-300x180.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-2_Delta-accelaration.png 1280w\" width=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>This graph talks about the ‘Delta Acceleration’ – there are 4 delta stages mentioned in the graph, let us look into each one of them.</p>\n<p>Before we move ahead with the following discussion some points for you here –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I would advise you to pay a lot of attention to the following discussion, these are some of the really important points to know and remember</li>\n<li>Do recollect and revise the delta table (option type, approximate delta value etc) from the previous chapter</li>\n<li>Please do bear in mind the delta and premium numbers used here is an intelligent assumption for the sake of this illustration –</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Predevelopment</strong> – This is the stage when the option is OTM or deep OTM. The delta here is close to 0. The delta will remain close to 0 even when the option moves from deep OTM to OTM. For example when spot is 8400, 8700 Call Option is Deep OTM, which is likely to have a delta of 0.05. Now even if the spot moves from 8400 to let us say 8500, the delta of 8700 Call option will not move much as 8700 CE is still an OTM option. The delta will still be a small non – zero number.</p>\n<p>So if the premium for 8700 CE when spot is at 8400 is Rs.12, then when Nifty moves to 8500 (100 point move) the premium is likely to move by 100 * 0.05 = 5 points.</p>\n<p>Hence the new premium will be Rs.12 + 5 = Rs.17/-. However the 8700 CE is now considered slightly OTM and not really deep OTM.</p>\n<p>Most important to note – the change in premium value in absolute terms maybe small (Rs.5/-) but in percentage terms the Rs.12/- option has changed by 41.6% to Rs.17/-</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> – Deep OTM options tends to put on an impressive percentage however for this to happen the spot has to move by a large value.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> – avoid buying <strong>deep OTM</strong> options because the deltas are really small and the underlying has to move massively for the option to work in your favor. There is more bang for the buck elsewhere. However for the very same reason selling deep OTM makes sense, but we will evaluate when to sell these options when we take up the Greek ‘Theta’.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Take off &amp; Acceleration</strong><strong> – </strong>This is the stage when the option transitions from OTM to ATM. This is where the maximum bang for the buck lies, and therefore the risk.</p>\n<p>Consider this – Nifty spot @ 8400, Strike is 8500 CE, option is slightly OTM, delta is 0.25, Premium is Rs.20/-.</p>\n<p>Spot moves from 8400 to 8500 (100 points), to figure out what happens on the premium side, let us do some math –</p>\n<p>Change in underlying = 100</p>\n<p>Delta for 8500 CE = 0.25</p>\n<p>Premium change = 100 * 0.25 = 25</p>\n<p>New premium = Rs.20 + 25 = Rs.45/-</p>\n<p>Percentage change = 125%</p>\n<p>Do you see that? For the same 100 point move slightly OTM options behaves very differently.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> – The slightly OTM option which usually has a delta value of say 0.2 or 0.3 is more sensitive to changes in the underlying. For any meaningful change in the underlying the percentage change in the slightly OTM options is very impressive. In fact this is exactly how option traders double or triple their money i.e. by buying slightly OTM options when they expect big moves in the underlying. But I would like to remind you that this is just one face of the cube, there are other faces we still need to explore.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation</strong> – Buying slightly OTM option is more expensive than buying deep OTM options, but if you get your act right you stand to make a killing. Whenever you buy options, consider buying slightly OTM options (of course assuming there is plenty of time to expiry, we will talk about this later).</p>\n<p>Let us take this forward and see how the ATM option would react for the same 100 point move.</p>\n<p>Spot = 8400</p>\n<p>Strike = 8400 (ATM)</p>\n<p>Premium = Rs.60/-</p>\n<p>Change in underlying = 100</p>\n<p>Delta for 8400 CE = 0.5</p>\n<p>Premium change = 100 * 0.5 = 50</p>\n<p>New premium = Rs.60 + 50 = Rs.110/-</p>\n<p>Percentage change = 83%</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion – </strong>ATM options are more sensitive to changes in the spot when compared to OTM options. Now because the ATM’s delta is high the underlying need not really move by a large value. Even if the underlying moves by a small value the option premium changes. However, buying ATM options are more expensive when compared to OTM options. <strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation – </strong>Buy ATM options when you want to play safe. The ATM option will move even if the underlying does not move by a large value. Also as a corollary, do not attempt to sell an ATM option unless you are very sure about what you are doing.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Stabilization</strong><strong> – </strong>When the option transitions from ATM to ITM and Deep ITM the delta starts to stabilize at 1. As we can see from the graph, the delta starts to flatten out when hits the value of 1. This means the option can be ITM or deep ITM but the delta gets fixed to 1 and would not change in value.</p>\n<p>Let us see how this works –</p>\n<p>Nifty Spot = 8400</p>\n<p>Option 1 = 8300 CE Strike, ITM option, Delta of 0.8, and Premium is Rs.105</p>\n<p>Option 2 = 8200 CE Strike, Deep ITM Option, Delta of 1.0, and Premium is Rs.210</p>\n<p>Change in underlying = 100 points, hence Nifty moves to 8500.</p>\n<p>Given this let us see how the two options behave –</p>\n<p>Change in premium for Option 1 = 100 * 0.8 = <strong>80</strong></p>\n<p>New Premium for Option 1 = Rs.105 + 80 = Rs.185/-</p>\n<p>Percentage Change = 80/105 = <strong>76.19%</strong></p>\n<p>Change in premium for Option 2 = 100 * 1 = <strong>100</strong></p>\n<p>New Premium for Option 2 = Rs.210 + 100 = Rs.310/-</p>\n<p>Percentage Change = 100/210 = <strong>47.6%</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion – </strong>In terms of the absolute change in the number of points, the deep ITM option scores over the slightly ITM option. However, in terms of percentage change, it is the other way round. Clearly ITM options are more sensitive to the changes in the underlying but certainly most expensive.</p>\n<p>Most importantly notice the change in the deep ITM option (delta 1) for a change of 100 points in the underlying there is a change of 100 points in the option premium. <strong>This means to say when you buy a deep ITM option it is as good as buying the underlying itself.</strong> This is because whatever is the change in the underlying, the deep ITM option will experience the same change.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation – </strong>Buy the ITM options when you want to play very safe. When I say safe, I’m contrasting the deep ITM option with deep OTM option. The ITM options have a high delta, which means they are most sensitive to changes in the underlying.</p>\n<p>Deep ITM option moves in line with the underlying, this means you can substitute a deep ITM option to a futures contract!</p>\n<p>Think about this –</p>\n<p>Nifty Spot @ 8400</p>\n<p>Nifty Futures = 8409</p>\n<p>Strike = 8000 (deep ITM)</p>\n<p>Premium = 450</p>\n<p>Delta = 1.0</p>\n<p>Change in spot = 30 points</p>\n<p>New Spot value = 8430</p>\n<p>Change in Futures = 8409 + 30 = 8439 à Reflects the entire 30 point change</p>\n<p>Change Option Premium = 1*30 = 30</p>\n<p>New Option Premium = 30 + 450 = 480 à Reflects the entire 30 point change</p>\n<p>So the point is, both futures and Deep ITM options react very similar to the changes in the underlying. Hence you are better off buying a Deep ITM option and therefore lessen your margin burden. However if you opt to do this, you need to constantly make sure that the Deep ITM option continues to remain Deep ITM (in other words make sure the delta is always 1), plus do keep an eye on the liquidity of the contract.</p>\n<p>I would suspect that at this stage the information contained in this chapter could be an overdose, especially if you are exploring the Greeks for the first time. I would suggest you take your time to learn this one bit at a time.</p>\n<p>There are few more angles we need to explore with respect to the delta, but will do that in the next chapter. However before we conclude this chapter let us summarize the discussion with the help of a table.</p>\n<p>This table will help us understand how different options behave differently given a certain change in the underlying.</p>\n<p>I’ve considered Bajaj Auto as the underlying. The price is 2210 and the expectation is a 30 point change in the underlying (which means we are expecting Bajaj Auto to hit 2240).  We will also assume there is plenty of time to expiry; hence time is not really a concern.</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Moneyness</th>\n<th>Strike</th>\n<th>Delta</th>\n<th>Old Premium</th>\n<th>Change in Premium</th>\n<th>New Premium</th>\n<th>% Change</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deep OTM</td>\n<td>2400</td>\n<td>0.05</td>\n<td>Rs.3/-</td>\n<td>30* 0.05 = 1.5</td>\n<td>3+1.5 = 4.5</td>\n<td>50%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slightly OTM</td>\n<td>2275</td>\n<td>0.3</td>\n<td>Rs.7/-</td>\n<td>30*0.3 = 9</td>\n<td>7 +9 = 16</td>\n<td>129%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ATM</td>\n<td>2210</td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n<td>Rs.12/-</td>\n<td>30*0.5 = 15</td>\n<td>12+15 = 27</td>\n<td>125%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Slightly ITM</td>\n<td>2200</td>\n<td>0.7</td>\n<td>Rs.22/-</td>\n<td>30*0.7 = 21</td>\n<td>22+21 = 43</td>\n<td>95.45%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deep ITM</td>\n<td>2150</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Rs.75/-</td>\n<td>30*1 = 30</td>\n<td>75 + 30 =105</td>\n<td>40%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As you can see each option behaves differently for the same move in the underlying.</p>\n<p>Before I wrap this chapter – I narrated a story to you earlier in this chapter following which I posted few questions.

We know for every point change in the underlying’s spot value the futures also changes by 1 point. For example if Nifty Spot moves from 8340 to 8350 then the Nifty Futures will also move from 8347 to 8357 (i.e. assuming Nifty Futures is trading at 8347 when the spot is at 8340). If we were to assign a delta value to Futures, clearly the future’s delta would be 1 as we know for every 1 point change in the underlying the futures also changes by 1 point.</p>\n<p>Now, assume I buy 1 ATM option which has a delta of 0.5, then we know that for every 1 point move in the underlying the option moves by 0.5 points. In other words owning 1 ATM option is as good as holding half futures contract. Given this, if I hold 2 such ATM contracts, then it as good as holding 1 futures contract because the delta of the 2 ATM options i.e. 0.5 and 0.5, which adds up to total delta of 1! In other words the deltas of two or more option contracts can be added to evaluate the total delta of the position.</p>\n<p>Let us take up a few case studies to understand this better –</p>\n<p><strong>Case 1 – Nifty spot at 8125, trader has 3 different Call option.</strong></p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Sl No</th>\n<th>Contract</th>\n<th>Classification</th>\n<th>Lots</th>\n<th>Delta</th>\n<th>Position Delta</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>8000 CE</td>\n<td>ITM</td>\n<td>1 -Buy</td>\n<td>0.7</td>\n<td>+ 1 * 0.7 = + 0.7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>8120 CE</td>\n<td>ATM</td>\n<td>1 -Buy</td>\n<td>0.5</td>\n<td>+ 1 * 0.5 = + 0.5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>8300 CE</td>\n<td>Deep OTM</td>\n<td>1- Buy</td>\n<td>0.05</td>\n<td>+ 1 * 0.05 = + 0.05</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"5\"><strong>Total Delta of positions </strong></td>\n<td><strong>= 0.7 + 0.5 + 0.05 = + 1.25</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Observations –</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The positive sign next to 1 (in the Position Delta column) indicates ‘Long’ position</li>\n<li>The combined positions have a positive delta i.e. +1.25.

This technique of adding up the deltas is very helpful when you have multiple option positions running simultaneously and <strong>you want to identify the overall directional impact on the positions</strong>.</p>\n<p>In fact I would strongly recommend you always add the deltas of individual position to get a perspective – this helps you understand the sensitivity and leverage of your overall position.</p>\n<p>Also, here is another important point you need to remember –</p>\n<p>Delta of ATM option = 0.5</p>\n<p>If you have 2 ATM options = delta of the position is 1</p>\n<p>So, for every point change in the underlying the overall position also changes by 1 point (as the delta is 1). This means the option mimics the movement of a Futures contract. However, do remember these two options should not be considered as a surrogate for a futures contract. Remember the Futures contract is only affected by the direction of the market, however the options contracts are affected by many other variables besides the direction of the markets.</p>\n<p>There could be times when you would want to substitute the options contract instead of futures (mainly from the margins perspective) – but whenever you do so be completely aware of its implications, more on this topic as we proceed.</p>\n<h2>11.2 – Delta as a probability</h2>\n<p>Before we wrap up our discussion on Delta, here is another interesting application of Delta. You can use the Delta to gauge the probability of the <strong>option contract to expire in the money</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let me explain – when a trader buys an option (irrespective of Calls or Puts), what is that he aspires? For example what do you expect when you buy Nifty 8000 PE when the spot is trading at 8100? (Note 8000 PE is an OTM option here). Clearly we expect the market to fall so that the Put option starts to make money for us.</p>\n<p>In fact the trader hopes the spot price falls below the strike price so <strong>that the option transitions from an OTM option to ITM option </strong>– and in the process the premium goes higher and the trader makes money.</p>\n<p>The trader can use the delta of an option to figure out the probability of the option to transition from OTM to ITM.</p>\n<p>In the example 8000 PE is slightly OTM option; hence its delta must be below 0.5, let us fix it to 0.3 for the sake of this discussion.</p>\n<p>Now to figure out the probability of the option to transition from OTM to ITM, simply convert the delta to a percentage number.</p>\n<p>When converted to percentage terms, delta of 0.3 is 30%. Hence there is only 30% chance for the 8000 PE to transition into an ITM option.</p>\n<p>Interesting right? Now think about this situation – although an arbitrary situation, this in fact is a very real life market situation –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>8400 CE is trading at Rs.4/-</li>\n<li>Spot is trading at 8275</li>\n<li>There are two day left for expiry – would you buy this option?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Well, a typical trader would think that this is a low cost trade, after all the premium is just Rs.4/- hence there is nothing much to lose. In fact the trader could even convince himself thinking that if the trade works in his favor, he stands a chance to make a huge profit.</p>\n<p>Fair enough, in fact this is how options work. But let’s put on our ‘Model Thinking’ hat and figure out if this makes sense –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>8400 CE is deep OTM call option considering spot is at 8275</li>\n<li>The delta of this option could be around 0.1</li>\n<li>Delta suggests that there is only 10% chance for the option to expire ITM</li>\n<li>Add to this the fact that there are only 2 more days to expiry – the case <strong>against</strong> buying this option becomes stronger!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A prudent trader would never buy this option. However don’t you think it makes perfect sense to sell this option and pocket the premium? Think about it – there is just 10% chance for the option to expire ITM or in other words there is 90% chance for the option to expire as an OTM option. With such a huge probability favoring the seller, one should go ahead and take the trade with conviction!</p>\n<p>In the same line – what would be the delta of an ITM option? Close to 1 right? So this means there is a very high probability for an already ITM option to expire as ITM. In other words the probability of an ITM option expiring OTM is very low, so beware while shorting/writing ITM options as the odds are already against you!</p>\n<p>Remember smart trading is all about taking trades wherein the odds favor you, and to know if the odds favor you, you certainly need to know your numbers and don your ‘Model Thinking’ hat.</p>\n<p>And with this I hope you have developed a fair understanding on the very first Option Greek – The delta.</p>\n<p>The Gamma beckons us now.</p>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The delta is additive in nature</li>\n<li>The delta of a futures contract is always 1</li>\n<li>Two ATM option is equivalent to owning 1 futures contract</li>\n<li>The options contract is not really a surrogate for the futures contract</li>\n<li>The delta of an option is also the probability for the option to expire ITM</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

The word ‘Derivatives’ meant something else to all  of us back then – it simply referred to solving lengthy differentiation and integration problems.</p>\n<p>Let me attempt to refresh your memory – the idea here is to just drive a certain point across and not really get into the technicalities of solving a calculus problem. Please note, the following discussion is very relevant to options, so please do read on.</p>\n<p>Consider this –</p>\n<p>A car is set into motion; it starts from 0 kms travels for 10 minutes and reaches the 3<sup>rd</sup> kilometer mark.

Here the velocity is being expressed in Kms travelled per minute, clearly this is not a convention we use in our day to day conversation as we are used to express speed or velocity in Kms travelled per hour (KMPH).</p>\n<p>We can convert 4/5 to KMPH by making a simple mathematical adjustment –</p>\n<p>5 minutes when expressed in hours equals 5/60 hours, plugging this back in the above equation</p>\n<p>= 4 / (5/ 60)</p>\n<p>= (4*60)/5</p>\n<p>= 48 Kmph</p>\n<p>Hence the car is moving at a velocity of 48 kmph (kilometers per hour).</p>\n<p>Do remember Velocity is <strong>change in distance travelled divided over change in time</strong>. In the calculus world, the Speed or Velocity is called the ‘<strong>1<sup>st</sup> order derivative</strong>’ of distance travelled.</p>\n<p>Now, let us take this example forward – In the 1<sup>st</sup> leg of the journey the car reached the 7<sup>th</sup> Kilometer after 15 minutes. Further assume in the 2<sup>nd</sup> leg of journey, starting from the 7<sup>th</sup> kilometer mark the car travels for another 5 minutes and reaches the 15<sup>th</sup> kilometer mark.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ch12-diagram-2.png\"><img alt=\"Ch12-diagram-2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2097\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"80\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ch12-diagram-2.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ch12-diagram-2.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ch12-diagram-2-300x30.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>We know the velocity of the car in the first leg was 48 kmph, and we can easily calculate the velocity for the 2<sup>nd</sup> leg of the journey as 96 kmph (here dx = 8 and dt = 5).</p>\n<p>It is quite obvious that the car travelled twice as fast in the 2<sup>nd</sup> leg of the journey.</p>\n<p>Let us call the change in velocity as ‘dv’. Change in velocity as we know is also called ‘Acceleration’.</p>\n<p>We know the change in velocity is</p>\n<p>= 96KMPH – 48 KMPH</p>\n<p>= 48 KMPH /??</p>\n<p>The above answer suggests that the change in velocity is 48 KMPH…. but over what? Confusing right?</p>\n<p>Let me explain –</p>\n<p>** <em>The following explanation may seem like a digression from the main topic about Gamma, but it is not, so please read on, if not for anything it will refresh your high school physics ☺</em> **</p>\n<p>When you want to buy a new car, the first thing the sales guy tells you is something like this – “the car is really fast as it can accelerate 0 to 60 in 5 seconds”. Essentially he is telling you that the car can change velocity from 0 KMPH (from the state of complete rest) to 60 KMPH in 5 seconds. Change in velocity here is 60KMPH (60 – 0) <strong>over 5 seconds</strong>.</p>\n<p>Likewise in the above example we know the change in velocity is 48KMPH but over what? Unless we answer “over what” part, we would not know what the acceleration really is.</p>\n<p>To find out the acceleration in this particular case, we can make some assumptions –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Acceleration is constant</li>\n<li>We can ignore the 7<sup>th</sup> kilometer mark for time being – hence we consider the fact that the car was at 3<sup>rd</sup> kilometer mark at the 10<sup>th</sup> minute and it reached the 15<sup>th</sup> kilometer mark at the 20<sup>th</sup> minute</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ch12-diagram-3.png\"><img alt=\"Ch12-diagram-3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2098\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"80\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ch12-diagram-3.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ch12-diagram-3.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ch12-diagram-3-300x30.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Using the above information, we can further deduce more information (in the calculus world, these are called the ‘initial conditions’).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Velocity @ the 10<sup>th</sup> minute (or 3<sup>rd</sup> kilometer mark) = 0 KMPS. This is called the initial velocity</li>\n<li>Time lapsed @ the 3<sup>rd</sup> kilometer mark = 10 minutes</li>\n<li>Acceleration is constant between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> kilometer mark</li>\n<li>Time at 15<sup>th</sup> kilometer mark = 20 minutes</li>\n<li>Velocity @ 20<sup>th</sup> minute (or 15<sup>th</sup> kilometer marks) is called ‘Final Velocity”</li>\n<li>While we know the initial velocity was 0 kmph, we do not know the final velocity</li>\n<li>Total distance travelled = 15 – 3 = 12 kms</li>\n<li>Total driving time = 20 -10 = 10 minutes</li>\n<li>Average speed (velocity) = 12/10 = 1.2 kmps per minute or in terms of hours it would be 72 kmph</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now think about this, we know –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial velocity = 0 kmph</li>\n<li>Average velocity = 72 kmph</li>\n<li>Final velocity =??</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By reverse engineering we know the final velocity should be 144 Kmph as the average of 0 and 144 is 72.</p>\n<p>Further we know acceleration is calculated as = Final Velocity / time (provided acceleration is constant).</p>\n<p>Hence the acceleration is –</p>\n<p>= 144 kmph / 10 minutes</p>\n<p>10 minutes when converted to hours is (10/60) hours, plugging this back in the above equation</p>\n<p>= 144 kmph / (10/60) hour</p>\n<p>= 864 Kilometers <strong>per hour. </strong></p>\n<p>This means the car is gaining a speed of 864 kilometers every hour, and if a salesman is selling you this car, he would say the car can accelerate 0 to 72kmph in 5 secs (I’ll let you do this math).</p>\n<p>We simplified this problem a great deal by making one assumption – acceleration is constant. However in reality acceleration is not constant, you accelerate at different speeds for obvious reasons. Generally speaking, to calculate such problems <strong>involving change in one variable due to the change in another variable</strong> one would have to dig into derivative calculus, more precisely one needs to use the concept of ‘differential equations’.</p>\n<p>Now just think about this for a moment –</p>\n<p>We know change in distance travelled (position) = Velocity, this is also called the 1<sup>st</sup> order derivative of distance position.</p>\n<p>Change in Velocity = Acceleration</p>\n<p>Acceleration = Change in Velocity over time, which is in turn the change in position over time.</p>\n<p>Hence it is apt to call Acceleration as the 2<sup>nd</sup> order derivative of the position or the 1<sup>st</sup> derivative of Velocity!</p>\n<p>Keep this point about the 1<sup>st</sup> order derivative and 2<sup>nd</sup> order derivative in perspective as we now proceed to understand the Gamma.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch12-title\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2099\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"240\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M5-Ch12-title.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M5-Ch12-title.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M5-Ch12-title-300x120.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>12.2 – Drawing Parallels</h2>\n<p>Over the last few chapters we understood how Delta of an option works. Delta as we know represents the change in premium for the given change in the underlying price.</p>\n<p>For example if the Nifty spot value is 8000, then we know the 8200 CE option is OTM, hence its delta could be a value between 0 and 0.5. Let us fix this to 0.2 for the sake of this discussion.</p>\n<p>Assume Nifty spot jumps 300 points in a single day, this means the 8200 CE is no longer an OTM option, rather it becomes slightly ITM option and therefore by virtue of this jump in spot value, the delta of 8200 CE will no longer be 0.2, it would be somewhere between 0.5 and 1.0, let us assume 0.8.</p>\n<p>With this change in underlying, one thing is very clear – <strong>the delta itself changes</strong>. Meaning delta is a variable, whose value changes based on the changes in the underlying and the premium! If you notice, Delta is very similar to velocity whose value changes with change in time and the distance travelled.</p>\n<p>The Gamma of an option measures this change in delta for the given change in the underlying. In other words Gamma of an option helps us answer this question – “For a given change in the underlying, what will be the corresponding change in the delta of the option?”</p>\n<p>Now, let us re-plug the velocity and acceleration example and draw some parallels to Delta and Gamma.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">1<sup>st</sup> order Derivative</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change in distance travelled (position) with respect to change in time is captured by velocity, and velocity is called the 1<sup>st</sup> order derivative of position</li>\n<li>Change in premium with respect to change in underlying is captured by delta, and hence delta is called the 1<sup>st</sup> order derivative of the premium</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">2<sup>nd</sup> order Derivative</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change in velocity with respect to change in time is captured by acceleration, and acceleration is called the 2<sup>nd</sup> order derivative of position</li>\n<li>Change in delta is with respect to change in the underlying value is captured by Gamma, hence Gamma is called the 2<sup>nd</sup> order derivative of the premium</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can imagine, calculating the values of Delta and Gamma (and in fact all other Option Greeks) involves number crunching and heavy use of calculus (differential equations and stochastic calculus).</p>\n<p>Here is a trivia for you – as we know, derivatives are called derivatives because the derivative contracts derives its value based on the value of its respective underlying.</p>\n<p>This value that the derivatives contracts derive from its respective underlying is measured using the application of “Derivatives” as a mathematical concept, hence the reason why Futures &amp; Options are referred to as ‘Derivatives’ ☺.</p>\n<p>You may be interested to know there is a parallel trading universe out there where traders apply derivative calculus to find trading opportunities day in and day out. In the trading world, such traders are generally called ‘Quants’, quite a fancy nomenclature I must say. Quantitative trading is what really exists on the other side of this mountain called ‘Markets’.</p>\n<p>From my experience, understanding the 2<sup>nd</sup> order derivative such as Gamma is not an easy task, although we will try and simplify it as much as possible in the subsequent chapters.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Financial derivatives are called Financial derivatives because of its dependence on calculus and differential equations (generally called Derivatives)</li>\n<li>Delta of an option is a variable and changes for every change in the underlying and premium</li>\n<li>Gamma captures the rate of change of delta, it helps us get an answer for a question such as “What is the expected value of delta for a given change in underlying”</li>\n<li>Delta is the 1<sup>st</sup> order derivative of premium</li>\n<li>Gamma is the 2<sup>nd</sup> order derivative of premium</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

Similar observations can be made on the red line representing the put option’s delta (except the value changes between 0 to -1). This graph reemphasizes what we already know, i.e. the delta is a variable, and it changes all the time. Given this, the question that one needs to answer is –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I know the delta changes, but why should I care about it?</li>\n<li>If the change in delta really matters, how do I estimate the likely change in the delta?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will talk about the 2<sup>nd</sup> question first as I’m reasonably certain the answer to the first question will reveal itself as we progress through this chapter.</p>\n<p>As introduced in the previous chapter, ‘The Gamma’ (2<sup>nd</sup> order derivative of premium) also referred to as <strong>the curvature of the option</strong> gives the rate at which the option’s delta changes as the underlying changes. The gamma is usually expressed in deltas gained or lost per one-point change in the underlying – with the delta increasing by the amount of the gamma when the underlying rises and falls by the amount of the gamma when the underlying falls.</p>\n<p>For example consider this –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nifty Spot = 8326</li>\n<li>Strike = 8400</li>\n<li>Option type = CE</li>\n<li>Moneyness of Option = Slightly OTM</li>\n<li>Premium = Rs.26/-</li>\n<li>Delta = 0.3</li>\n<li>Gamma = 0.0025</li>\n<li>Change in Spot = 70 points</li>\n<li>New Spot price = 8326 + 70 = 8396</li>\n<li>New Premium =??</li>\n<li>New Delta =??</li>\n<li>New moneyness =??</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s figure this out –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change in Premium = Delta * change in spot  i.e  0.3 * 70 = 21</li>\n<li>New premium = 21 + 26 = 47</li>\n<li>Rate of change of delta = 0.0025 units for every 1 point change in underlying</li>\n<li>Change in delta = Gamma * Change in underlying  i.e  0.0025*70 = 0.175</li>\n<li><strong>New Delta = Old Delta + Change in Delta  i.e  0.3 + 0.175 = 0.475</strong></li>\n<li>New Moneyness = ATM</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When Nifty moves from 8326 to 8396, the 8400 CE premium changed from Rs.26 to Rs.47, and along with this the Delta changed from 0.3 to 0.475.</p>\n<p>Notice with the change of 70 points, the option transitions from slightly OTM to ATM option. Which means the option’s delta has to change from 0.3 to somewhere close to 0.5. This is exactly what’s happening here.</p>\n<p>Further, let us assume Nifty moves up another 70 points from 8396; let us see what happens with the 8400 CE option –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Old spot = 8396</li>\n<li>New spot value = 8396 + 70 = 8466</li>\n<li>Old Premium = 47</li>\n<li>Old Delta = 0.475</li>\n<li>Change in Premium = 0.475 * 70 = 33.25</li>\n<li>New Premium = 47 + 33.25 = 80.25</li>\n<li>New moneyness = ITM (hence delta should be higher than 0.5)</li>\n<li>Change in delta =0.0025 * 70 = 0.175</li>\n<li>New Delta = 0.475 + 0.175 = <strong>0.65</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s take this forward a little further, now assume Nifty falls by 50 points, let us see what happens with the 8400 CE option –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Old spot = 8466</li>\n<li>New spot value = 8466 – 50 = 8416</li>\n<li>Old Premium = 80.25</li>\n<li>Old Delta = 0.65</li>\n<li>Change in Premium = 0.65 *(50) = – 32.5</li>\n<li>New Premium = 80.25 – 32. 5 = <b>47.75 </b></li>\n<li>New moneyness = slightly ITM (hence delta should be higher than 0.5)</li>\n<li>Change in delta = 0.0025 * (50) = <strong>– 0.125</strong></li>\n<li>New Delta = 0.65 – 0.125 = <strong>0.525</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notice how well the delta transitions and adheres to the delta value rules we discussed in the earlier chapters. Also, you may wonder why the Gamma value is kept constant in the above examples. Well, in reality, the Gamma also changes with the change in the underlying. This change in Gamma due to changes in underlying is captured by 3<sup>rd</sup> derivative of underlying called “Speed” or “Gamma of Gamma” or “<strong>D</strong>gamma<strong>D</strong>spot”. For all practical purposes, it is not necessary to get into the discussion of Speed, unless you are mathematically inclined or you work for an Investment Bank where the trading book risk can run into several $ Millions.</p>\n<p>Unlike the delta, the Gamma is always a positive number for both Call and Put Option. Therefore when a trader is long options (both Calls and Puts), the trader is considered ‘Long Gamma’, and when he is short options (both calls and puts) he is considered ‘Short Gamma’.</p>\n<p>For example, consider this – The Gamma of an ATM Put option is 0.004, if the underlying moves 10 points, what do you think the new delta is?</p>\n<p>Before you proceed, I would suggest you spend a few minutes to think about the solution for the above.</p>\n<p>Here is the solution – Since we are talking about an ATM Put option, the Delta must be around – 0.5. Remember Put options have a –ve Delta. Gamma, as you notice, is a positive number, i.e. +0.004. The underlying moves by 10 points without specifying the direction, so let us figure out what happens in both cases.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Case 1 – Underlying moves up by 10 points</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delta = – 0.5</li>\n<li>Gamma = 0.004</li>\n<li>Change in underlying = 10 points</li>\n<li>Change in Delta = Gamma * Change in underlying = 0.004 * 10 = 0.04</li>\n<li>New Delta = We know the Put option loses delta when underlying increases, hence – 0.5 + 0.04 = <strong>– 0.46</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Case 2 – Underlying goes down by 10 points</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delta = – 0.5</li>\n<li>Gamma = 0.004</li>\n<li>Change in underlying = – 10 points</li>\n<li>Change in Delta = Gamma * Change in underlying = 0.004 * – 10 = – 0.04</li>\n<li>New Delta = We know the Put option gains delta when underlying goes down, hence – 0.5 + (-0.04) = <strong>– 0.54</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, here is a trick question for you – In the earlier chapters, we had discussed that the Delta of the Futures contract is always 1, so what do you think the gamma of the Futures contract is? Please leave your answers in the comment box below :).</p>\n<h2>13.2 – Estimating Risk using Gamma</h2>\n<p>I know many traders define their risk limits while trading. Here is what I mean by a risk limit – for example, the trader may have a capital of Rs.300,000/- in his trading account. Margin required for each Nifty Futures is approximately Rs.16,500/-. Do note you can use Zerodha’s <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/margin-calculator/SPAN/\"><strong>SPAN calculator</strong></a> to figure out the margin required for any F&amp;O contract.  So considering the margin and the M2M margin required, the trader may decide at any point he may not want to exceed holding more than <strong>5 Nifty Futures contracts</strong>, thus defining his risk limits, this seems fair enough and works really well while trading futures.</p>\n<p>But does the same logic work while trading options? Let’s figure out if it is the right way to think about risk while trading options.</p>\n<p>Here is a situation –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of lots traded = 10 lots (Note – 10 lots of ATM contracts with a delta of 0.5 each is equivalent to 5 Futures contract)</li>\n<li>Option = 8400 CE</li>\n<li>Spot = 8405</li>\n<li>Delta = 0.5</li>\n<li>Gamma = 0.005</li>\n<li>Position = Short</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The trader is short 10 lots of Nifty 8400 Call Option; this means the trader is within his risk boundary. Recall the discussion we had in the Delta chapter about adding up the delta. We can essentially add up the deltas to get the overall delta of the position. Also, each delta of 1 represents 1 lot of the underlying. So we will keep this in perspective, and we can figure out the overall position’s delta.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delta = 0.5</li>\n<li>Number of lots = 10</li>\n<li>Position Delta = 10 * 0.5 = <strong>5</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So from the overall delta perspective, the trader is within his risk boundary of trading not more than 5 Futures lots. Also, do note since the trader is short options, he is essentially <strong>short gamma</strong>.</p>\n<p>The position’s delta of 5 indicates that the trader’s position will move 5 points for every 1 point movement in the underlying.</p>\n<p>Now, assume Nifty moves 70 points against him, and the trader continues to hold his position, hoping for a recovery. The trader is obviously under the impression that he is holding 10 lots of options which is within his risk appetite…</p>\n<p>Let’s do some forensics to figure out behind the scenes changes –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delta = 0.5</li>\n<li>Gamma = 0.005</li>\n<li>Change in underlying = 70 points</li>\n<li>Change in Delta = Gamma * change in underlying = 0.005 * 70 = 0.35</li>\n<li>New Delta = 0.5 + 0.35 =<strong> 0.85</strong></li>\n<li>New Position Delta = 0.85*10 = <b>8.5</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do you see the problem here? Although the trader has defined his risk limit of 5 lots, thanks to a high Gamma value, he has overshot his risk limit and now holds positions equivalent to 8.5 lots, way beyond his perceived risk limit. An inexperienced trader can be caught unaware of this and still be under the impression that he is well under his risk radar. But in reality, his risk exposure is getting higher.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch13-cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2243\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M5-Ch13-cartoon1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M5-Ch13-cartoon1.png 500w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/M5-Ch13-cartoon1-300x180.png 300w\" width=\"500\"/></p>\n<p>Now since the delta is 8.5, his overall position is expected to move 8.5 points for every 1 point change in the underlying. For a moment, assume the trader is long on the call option instead of being short – obviously, he would enjoy the situation here as the market is moving in his favour. Besides the favourable movement in the market, his positions are getting ‘Longer’ since the ‘long gamma’ tends to add up the deltas. Therefore the delta tends to get bigger, which means the rate of change on premium concerning the change in underlying is faster.</p>\n<p>Suggest you read that again in small bits if you found it confusing.</p>\n<p>But since the trader is short, he is essentially short gamma…this means when the position moves against him (as in the market moves up while he is short) the deltas add up (thanks to gamma) and therefore at every stage of market increase, the delta and gamma gang up against the short option trader, making his position riskier way beyond what the plain eyes can see. Perhaps this is the reason why they say – shorting options carry a huge amount of risk. In fact, you can be more precise and say “shorting options carry the risk of being short gamma”.</p>\n<p>Note – By no means I’m suggesting that you should not short options. In fact, a successful trader employs both short and long positions as the situation demands. I’m only suggesting that when you short options, you need to be aware of the Greeks and what they can do to your positions.</p>\n<p>Also, I’d strongly suggest you avoid shorting option contracts which has a large Gamma.</p>\n<p>This leads us to another interesting topic – what is considered as ‘large gamma’.</p>\n<h2>13.3 – Gamma movement</h2>\n<p>Earlier in the chapter, we briefly discussed that the Gamma changes concerning the change in the underlying. This change in Gamma is captured by the 3<sup>rd</sup> order derivative called ‘Speed’. I won’t get into discussing ‘Speed’ for reasons stated earlier. However, we need to know the behaviour of Gamma movement so that we can avoid initiating trades with high Gamma.  Of course, there are other advantages of knowing the behaviour of Gamma, and we will talk about this at a later stage in this module. But for now, we will look into how the Gamma behaves concerning changes in the underlying.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the chart below,</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-2_Gamma-vs-Spot.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_Gamma vs Spot\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2246\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"246\" sizes=\"(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-2_Gamma-vs-Spot.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-2_Gamma-vs-Spot.png 671w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Image-2_Gamma-vs-Spot-300x110.png 300w\" width=\"671\"/></a></p>\n<p>The chart above has 3 different CE strike prices – 80, 100, and 120 and their respective Gamma movement. For example, the blue line represents the Gamma of the 80 CE strike price. I would suggest you look at each graph individually to avoid confusion. In fact, for the sake of simplicity, I will only talk about the 80 CE strike option, represented by the blue line.</p>\n<p>Let us assume the spot price is at 80, thus making the 80 strike ATM. Keeping this in perspective we can observe the following from the above chart –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Since the strike under consideration is 80 CE, the option attains ATM status when the spot price equals 80</li>\n<li>Strike values below 80 (65, 70, 75 etc) are ITM and values above 80 (85, 90, 95 etx) are OTM options.</li>\n<li>Notice the gamma value is low for OTM Options (80 and above). This explains why the premium for OTM options doesn’t change much in terms of absolute point terms; however, in % terms, the change is bigger. For example – the premium of an OTM option can change from Rs.2 to Rs.2.5, while the absolute change in is just 50 paisa, the % change is 25%.</li>\n<li>The gamma peaks when the option hits ATM status. This implies that the rate of change of delta is highest when the option is ATM. In other words, ATM options are most sensitive to the changes in the underlying.\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Also, since ATM options have the highest Gamma – <strong>avoid shorting ATM options.</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The gamma value is also low for ITM options (80 and below). Hence for a certain change in the underlying, the rate of change of delta for an ITM option is much lesser compared to ATM option. However, do remember the ITM option inherently has a high delta. So while ITM delta reacts slowly to the change in underlying (due to low gamma) the change in premium is big (due to high base value of delta).</li>\n<li>You can observe similar Gamma behaviour for other strikes, i.e. 100, and 120. In fact, the reason to show different strikes is to showcase the fact that the gamma behaves in the same way for all options strikes</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Just in case you found the above discussion bit overwhelming, here are 3 simple points that you can take home –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delta changes rapidly for ATM option.</li>\n<li>Delta changes slowly for OTM and ITM options.</li>\n<li>Never short ATM or ITM option with a hope that they will expire worthless upon expiry</li>\n<li>OTM options are great candidates for short trades assuming you intend to hold these short trades upto expiry wherein you expect the option to expire worthlessly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>13.4 – Quick note on Greek interactions</h2>\n<p>One of the keys to successful options trading is to understand how the individual option Greeks behave under various circumstances. Now besides understanding the individual Greek behaviour, one also needs to understand how these individual option Greeks react with each other.</p>\n<p>So far, we have considered only the premium change concerning the changes in the spot price. We have not yet discussed time and volatility. Think about the markets and the real-time changes that happen. Everything changes – time, volatility, and the underlying price. So an options trader should be in a position to understand these changes and its overall impact on the option premium.</p>\n<p>You will fully appreciate this only when you understand the cross interactions of the option Greeks. Typical Greek cross interactions would be – gamma versus time, gamma versus volatility, volatility vs time, time vs delta etc.</p>\n<p>Finally, all your understanding of the Greeks boils down to a few critical decision making factors such as –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For the given market circumstances, which is the best strike to trade?</li>\n<li>What is your expectation of the premium of that particular strike – would it increase or decrease? Hence would you be a buyer or a seller in that option?</li>\n<li>If you plan to buy an option – is there a realistic chance for the premium to increase?</li>\n<li>If you plan to short an option – is it really safe to do so? Are you able to see risk beyond what the naked eyes can spot?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The answers to all these questions will evolve once you fully understand individual Greeks and their cross interactions.</p>\n<p>Given this, here is how this module will develop going further –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>So far, we have understood Delta and Gamma.</li>\n<li>Over the next few chapters, we will understand Theta and Vega.</li>\n<li>When we introduce Vega (change in premium concerning the change in volatility) – we will digress slightly to understand volatility based stoploss</li>\n<li>Introduce Greek cross interactions – Gamma vs time, Gamma vs spot, Theta vs Vega, Vega vs Spot etc</li>\n<li>Overview of Black and Scholes option pricing formula</li>\n<li>Option calculator</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So as you see, we have miles to walk before we sleep :-).</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Gamma measures the rate of change of delta.</li>\n<li>Gamma is always a positive number for both Calls and Puts.</li>\n<li>Large Gamma can translate to large gamma risk (directional risk)</li>\n<li>When you buy options (Calls or Puts) you are long Gamma.</li>\n<li>When you short options (Calls or Puts) you are short Gamma</li>\n<li>Avoid shorting options which have a large gamma.</li>\n<li>Delta changes rapidly for ATM option.</li>\n<li>Delta changes slowly for OTM and ITM options.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to our good friend <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/prakashlekkala\">Prakash Lekkala</a> for providing the Greek graphs in this and other chapters<strong>.</strong></em></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

Forget all the Greek talk for now, we shall go back to understand one basic concept concerning time. Assume you have enrolled for a competitive exam, you are inherently a bright candidate and have the capability to clear the exam, however, if you do not give it sufficient time and brush up the concepts, you are likely to flunk the exam – so given this what is the likelihood that you will pass this exam? Well, it depends on how much time you spend to prepare for the exam right? Let’s keep this in perspective and figure out the likelihood of passing the exam against the time spent preparing for the exam.</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Number of days for preparation</th>\n<th>Likelihood of passing</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 days</td>\n<td>Very high</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 days</td>\n<td>High</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15 days</td>\n<td>Moderate</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10 days</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5 days</td>\n<td>Very low</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 day</td>\n<td>Ultra-low</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Quite obviously higher the number of days for preparation, the higher is the likelihood of passing the exam. Keeping the same logic in mind, think about the following situation – Nifty Spot is 8500, you buy a Nifty 8700 Call option – what is the likelihood of this call option to expire In the Money (ITM)? Let me rephrase this question in the following way –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Given Nifty is at 8500 today, what is the likelihood of Nifty moving 200 points over the next 30 days and therefore 8700 CE expiring ITM?\n<ul>\n<li>The chance for Nifty to move 200 points over the next 30 days is quite high, hence the likelihood of an option expiring ITM upon expiry is <strong>very high</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>What if there are only 15 days to expiry?\n<ul>\n<li>An expectation that Nifty will move 200 points over the next 15 days is reasonable, hence the likelihood of an option expiring ITM upon expiry is <strong>high </strong>(notice it is not very high, but just high).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>What if there are only 5 days to expiry?\n<ul>\n<li>Well, 5 days, 200 points, not really sure hence the likelihood of 8700 CE expiring in the money is <strong>low</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>What if there was only 1 day to expiry?\n<ul>\n<li>The probability of Nifty to move 200 points in 1 day is quite low, hence I would be reasonably certain that the option will not expire in the money, therefore the chance is <strong>ultra-low.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is there anything that we can infer from the above? Clearly, the more time for expiry the likelihood for the option to expire In the Money (ITM) is higher. Now keep this point in the back of your mind as we now shift our focus on the ‘Option Seller’. We know an option seller sells/writes an option and receives the premium for it. When he sells an option he is very well aware that he carries an unlimited risk and limited reward potential. The reward is limited to the extent of the premium he receives. He gets to keep his reward (premium) <strong>fully</strong> only if the option expires worthless. Now, think about this – if he is selling an option <strong>early in the month</strong> he very clearly knows the following –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He knows he carries unlimited risk and limited reward potential</li>\n<li>He also knows that by virtue of time, there is a chance for the option he is selling to transition into ITM option, which means he will not get to retain his reward (premium received)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In fact at any given point, thanks to ‘time’, there is always a chance for the option to expire in the money (although this chance gets lower and lower as time progresses towards the expiry date). Given this, an option seller would not want to sell options at all right? After all, why would you want to sell options when you very well know that simply because of time there is scope for the option you are selling to expire in the money. Clearly, time in the option sellers context acts as a risk. Now, what if the option buyer in order to entice the option seller to sell options offers to compensate for the ‘time risk’ that he (option seller) assumes? In such a case it probably makes sense to evaluate the time risk versus the compensation and take a call right? In fact, this is what happens in real-world options trading. Whenever you pay a premium for options, you are indeed paying towards –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Time Risk</li>\n<li>The intrinsic value of options.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In other words – <strong style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Premium = Time value + Intrinsic Value</strong> Recall earlier in this module we defined ‘Intrinsic Value’ as the money you are to receive if you were to exercise your option today. Just to refresh your memory, let us calculate the intrinsic value for the following options assuming Nifty is at 8423 –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>8350 CE</li>\n<li>8450 CE</li>\n<li>8400 PE</li>\n<li>8450 PE</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We know the intrinsic value is <strong>always a positive value or zero and can never be below zero</strong>. If the value turns out to be negative, then the intrinsic value is considered zero. We know for Call options the intrinsic value is “<strong>Spot Price – Strike Price</strong>” and for Put options, it is “<strong>Strike Price – Spot Price</strong>”. Hence the intrinsic values for the above options are as follows –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>8350 CE = 8423 – 8350 = +73</li>\n<li>8450 CE = 8423 – 8450 = -ve value hence 0</li>\n<li>8400 PE = 8400 – 8423 = -ve value hence 0</li>\n<li>8450 PE = 8450 – 8423 = + 27</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So given that we know how to calculate the intrinsic value of an option, let us attempt to decompose the premium and extract the time value and intrinsic value. Have a look at the following snapshot – <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-1-_IVTV.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1 _IVTV\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2361\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"477\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-1-_IVTV.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-1-_IVTV.png 572w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-1-_IVTV-300x250.png 300w\" width=\"572\"/></a> Details to note are as follows –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spot Value = 8531</li>\n<li>Strike = 8600 CE</li>\n<li>Status = OTM</li>\n<li>Premium = 99.4</li>\n<li>Today’s date = 6<sup>th</sup> July 2015</li>\n<li>Expiry = 30<sup>th</sup> July 2015</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Intrinsic value of a call option – Spot Price – Strike Price i.e 8531 – 8600 = 0 (since it’s a negative value) We know – Premium = Time value + Intrinsic value 99.4 = Time Value + 0 This implies Time value = 99.4! Do you see that? The market is willing to pay a premium of Rs.99.4/- for an option that has zero intrinsic value but ample time value! Recall <strong>time is money </strong><strong>☺</strong> Here is a snapshot of the same contract that I took the next day i.e 7<sup>th</sup> July – <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-3_IVTV.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_IVTV\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2363\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"481\" sizes=\"(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-3_IVTV.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-3_IVTV.png 577w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-3_IVTV-300x250.png 300w\" width=\"577\"/></a> Notice the underlying value has gone up slightly (8538) but the option premium has decreased quite a bit! Let’s decompose the premium into its intrinsic value and time value – Spot Price – Strike Price  i.e  8538 – 8600 = 0 (since it’s a negative value) We know – Premium = Time value + Intrinsic value 87.9 = Time Value + 0 This implies Time value = 87.9! Notice the overnight drop in premium value? We will soon understand why this happened. Note – In this example, the drop in premium value is 99.4 minus 87.9 = 11.5. This drop is attributable to a drop in <strong>volatility and time</strong>. We will talk about volatility in the next chapter. For the sake of argument, if both volatility and spot were constant, the drop in premium would be completely attributable to the passage of time. I would suspect this drop would be around Rs.5 or so and not really Rs.11.5/-. Let us take another example – <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-2_ITVT.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_ITVT\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2362\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"477\" sizes=\"(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-2_ITVT.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-2_ITVT.png 569w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-2_ITVT-300x251.png 300w\" width=\"569\"/></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spot Value = 8514.5</li>\n<li>Strike = 8450 CE</li>\n<li>Status = ITM</li>\n<li>Premium = 160</li>\n<li>Today’s date = 7<sup>th</sup> July 2015</li>\n<li>Expiry = 30<sup>th</sup> July 2015</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Intrinsic value of call option – Spot Price – Strike Price  i.e  8514.5 – 8450 = 64.5 We know – Premium = Time value + Intrinsic value 160 = Time Value + 64.5 This implies the Time value = 160 – 64.5 = 95.5 Hence out of the total premium of Rs.160, traders are paying 64.5 towards intrinsic value and 95.5 towards the time value. You can repeat the calculation for all options (both calls and puts) and decompose the premium into the Time value and intrinsic value.</p>\n<h2>14.2 – Movement of time</h2>\n<p>Time as we know moves in one direction. Keep the expiry date as the target time and think about the movement of time. Quite obviously as time progresses, the number of days for expiry gets lesser and lesser. Given this let me ask you this question – With roughly 18 trading days to expiry, traders are willing to pay as much as Rs.100/- towards time value, will they do the same if the time to expiry was just 5 days? Obviously, they would not right? With lesser time to expiry, traders will pay a much lesser value towards time. In fact here is a snapshot that I took from the earlier months – <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-4_Idea-option-chain.png\"><img alt=\"Image 4_Idea option chain\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2364\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"473\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-4_Idea-option-chain.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-4_Idea-option-chain.png 572w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-4_Idea-option-chain-300x248.png 300w\" width=\"572\"/></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date = 29<sup>th</sup> April</li>\n<li>Expiry Date = 30<sup>th</sup> April</li>\n<li>Time to expiry = 1 day</li>\n<li>Strike = 190</li>\n<li>Spot = 179.6</li>\n<li>Premium = 30 Paisa</li>\n<li>Intrinsic Value = 179.6 – 190 = 0 since it’s a negative value</li>\n<li>Hence time value should be 30 paisa which equals the premium</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With 1 day to expiry, traders are willing to pay a time value of just 30 paise. However, if the time to expiry was 20 days or more the time value would probably be Rs.5 or Rs.8/-. The point that I’m trying to make here is this – with every passing day, as we get closer to the expiry day, the time to expiry becomes lesser and lesser. This means the option buyers will pay lesser and lesser towards time value. So if the option buyer pays Rs.10 as the time value today, tomorrow he would probably pay Rs.9.5/- as the time value. This leads us to a very important conclusion – “<strong>All other things being equal, an option is a depreciating asset. The option’s premium erodes daily and this is attributable to the passage of time</strong>”. Now the next logical question is – by how much would the premium decrease on a daily basis owing to the passage of time? Well, Theta the 3<sup>rd</sup> Option Greek helps us answer this question. <img alt=\"M5-Ch14-Cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2370\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/M5-Ch14-Cartoon2.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/M5-Ch14-Cartoon2.png 500w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/M5-Ch14-Cartoon2-300x180.png 300w\" width=\"500\"/></p>\n<h2>14.3 – Theta</h2>\n<p>All options – both Calls and Puts lose value as the expiration approaches. The Theta or <strong>time decay factor</strong> is the rate at which an option loses value as time passes. Theta is expressed in points lost per day when all other conditions remain the same. Time runs in one direction, hence theta is always a positive number, however, to remind traders it’s a loss in options value it is sometimes written as a negative number. A Theta of -0.5 indicates that the option premium will lose -0.5 points for every day that passes by. For example, if an option is trading at Rs.2.75/- with a theta of -0.05 then it will trade at Rs.2.70/- the following day (provided other things are kept constant). A long option (option buyer) will always have a negative theta meaning all else equal, the option buyer will lose money on a day by day basis. A short option (option seller) will have positive theta. Theta is a friendly Greek to the option seller. Remember the objective of the option seller is to retain the premium. Given that options lose value on a daily basis, the option seller can benefit by retaining the premium to the extent it loses value owing to time. For example, if an option writer has sold options at Rs.54, with a theta of 0.75, all else equal, the same option is likely to trade at – =0.75 * 3 = 2.25 = 54 – 2.25 = 51.75 Hence the seller can choose to close the option position on T+ 3 day by buying it back at Rs.51.75/- and profiting Rs.2.25 …and this is attributable to theta! Have a look at the graph below – <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-5_Time-Decay.png\"><img alt=\"Image 5_Time Decay\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2365\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"404\" sizes=\"(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-5_Time-Decay.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-5_Time-Decay.png 687w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-5_Time-Decay-300x176.png 300w\" width=\"687\"/></a> This is the graph of how premium erodes as a time to expiry approaches. This is also called the <strong>‘Time Decay’</strong> graph. We can observe the following from the graph –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At the start of the series – when there are many days for expiry, the option does not lose much value. For example, when there were 120 days to expiry the option was trading at 350, however, when there were 100 days to expiry, the option was trading at 300. Hence the effect of theta is <strong>low</strong></li>\n<li>As we approach the expiry of the series – the effect of theta is <strong>high</strong>. Notice when there were 20 days to expiry the option was trading around 150, but when we approach towards expiry the drop in premium seems to accelerate (option value drops below 50).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So if you are selling options at the start of the series – you have the advantage of pocketing a large premium value (as the time value is very high) but do remember the fall in premium happens at a low rate. You can sell options closer to the expiry – you will get a lower premium but the drop in premium is high, which is advantageous to the options seller. Theta is a relatively straightforward and easy Greek to understand. We will revisit theta again when we will discuss cross dependencies of Greeks. But for now, if you have understood all that’s being discussed here you are good to go. We shall now move forward to understand the last and the most interesting Greek – Vega!</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Option sellers are always compensated for the time risk</li>\n<li>Premium = Intrinsic Value + Time Value</li>\n<li>All else equal, options lose money on a daily basis owing to Theta</li>\n<li>Time moves in a single direction hence Theta is a positive number</li>\n<li>Theta is a friendly Greek to option sellers</li>\n<li>When you short naked options at the start of the series you can pocket a large time value but the fall in premium owing to time is low</li>\n<li>When you short option close to expiry the premium is low (thanks to time value) but the fall in premium is rapid</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

Vega, as most of you might have guessed is the rate of change of option premium concerning the change in volatility. But the question is – What is volatility? I have asked this question to quite a few traders, and the most common answer is “Volatility is the up-down movement of the stock market”. If you have a similar opinion on volatility, then it is about time we fixed that ☺.</p>\n<p>So here is the agenda, I suppose this topic will spill over a few chapters –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We will understand what volatility really means</li>\n<li>Understand how to measure volatility</li>\n<li>Practical Application of volatility</li>\n<li>Understand different types of volatility</li>\n<li>Understand Vega</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So let’s get started.</p>\n<h2>15.2 – Moneyball</h2>\n<p>Have you watched this Hollywood movie called ‘Moneyball’? It’s a real-life story, Billy Beane – manager of a baseball team in the US. The movie is about Billy Beane and his young colleague, and how they leverage the power of statistics to identify relatively low profile but extremely talented baseball players. A method that was unheard of during his time, and a method that proved to be both innovative and disruptive.</p>\n<p>You can watch the trailer of Moneyball <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4QPVo0UIzc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a></p>\n<p>I love this movie, not just for Brad Pitt, but for the message it drives across on topics related to life and business. I will not get into the details now, however, let me draw some inspiration from the Moneyball method, to help explain volatility :).</p>\n<p>The discussion below may appear unrelated to stock markets, but please don’t get discouraged. I can assure you that it is relevant and helps you relate better to the term ‘Volatility’.</p>\n<p>Consider 2 batsmen and the number of runs they have scored over 6 consecutive matches –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Match</th>\n<th>Billy</th>\n<th>Mike</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>45</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>24</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>26</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>23</td>\n<td>19</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You are the captain of the team, and you need to choose either Billy or Mike for the 7<sup>th</sup> match. The batsman should be dependable – in the sense that the batsman you choose should be in a position to score at least 20 runs. Whom would you choose? From my experience, I have noticed that people approach this problem in one of the two ways –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Calculate the total score (also called ‘<strong>Sigma</strong>’) of both the batsman – pick the batsman with the highest score for the next game. Or…</li>\n<li>Calculate the average (also called ‘<strong>Mean</strong>’) number of scores per game – pick the batsman with a better average.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let us calculate the same and see what numbers we get –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Billy’s Sigma = 20 + 23 + 21 + 24 + 19 + 23 = 130</li>\n<li>Mike’s Sigma = 45 + 13 + 18 + 12 + 26 + 19 = 133</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So based on the sigma, you are likely to select Mike. Let us calculate the mean or average for both the players and figure out who stands better –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Billy = 130/6 = 21.67</li>\n<li>Mike = 133/6 = 22.16</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So it seems from both the mean and sigma perspective, Mike deserves to be selected. But let us not conclude that yet. Remember the idea is to select a player who can score at least 20 runs, and with the information that we have now (mean and sigma), there is no way we can conclude who can score at least 20 runs. Therefore, let’s do some further investigation.</p>\n<p>To begin with, for each match played, we will calculate the deviation from the mean. For example, we know Billy’s mean is 21.67, and in his first match, Billy scored 20 runs. Therefore deviation from mean from the 1st match is 20 – 21.67 = <strong>– 1.67</strong>. In other words, he scored 1.67 runs lesser than his average score. For the 2<sup>nd</sup> match, it was 23 – 21.67 = <strong>+1.33, </strong>meaning he scored 1.33 runs more than his average score.</p>\n<p>Here is the diagram representing the same (for Billy) –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch15-graph.png\"><img alt=\"Ch15-graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2398\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch15-graph.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch15-graph.png 460w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ch15-graph-300x196.png 300w\" width=\"460\"/></a><br/>\nThe middle black line represents the average score of Billy, and the double arrowed vertical line represents the deviation from the mean, for each of the match played. We will now go ahead and calculate another variable called ‘Variance’.</p>\n<p>Variance is simply the ‘<strong>sum of the squares of the deviation divided by the total number of observations’</strong>. This may sound scary, but it’s not. We know the total number of observations, in this case, happens to be equivalent to the total number of matches played, hence 6.</p>\n<p>So variance can be calculated as –</p>\n<p>Variance = [(-1.67) ^2 + (1.33) ^2 + (-0.67) ^2 + (+2.33) ^2 + (-2.67) ^2 + (1.33) ^2] / 6<br/>\n= 19.33 / 6<br/>\n<strong>= 3.22</strong></p>\n<p>Further, we will define another variable called ‘<strong>Standard Deviation</strong>’ <strong>(SD) </strong>which is calculated as –</p>\n<p>std deviation = √<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\"> variance </span></p>\n<p>So the standard deviation for Billy is –<br/>\n= SQRT (3.22)<br/>\n= 1.79</p>\n<p>Likewise, Mike’s standard deviation works out to be 11.18.</p>\n<p>Let’s stack up all the numbers (or statistics) here –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Statistics</th>\n<th>Billy</th>\n<th>Mike</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sigma</td>\n<td>130</td>\n<td>133</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mean</td>\n<td>21.6</td>\n<td>22.16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SD</td>\n<td>1.79</td>\n<td>11.18</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We know what ‘Mean’, and ‘Sigma’ signifies, but what about the SD? Standard Deviation generalizes and represents the deviation from the average.</p>\n<p>Here is the textbook definition of SD “<em>In statistics, the <strong>standard deviation</strong> (SD, also represented by the Greek letter sigma, σ) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values</em>”.</p>\n<p>Please don’t get confused between the two sigma’s – the total is also called sigma represented by the Greek symbol ∑ and standard deviation is also sometimes referred to as sigma represented by the Greek symbol <em>σ. </em></p>\n<p>One way to use SD is to project how many runs Billy and Mike are likely to score in the next match. To get this projected score, you need to add and subtract the SD from their average.</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Player</th>\n<th>Lower Estimate</th>\n<th>Upper Estimate</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Billy</td>\n<td>21.6 – 1.79 = 19.81</td>\n<td>21.6 + 1.79 = 23.39</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mike</td>\n<td>22.16 – 11.18 = 10.98</td>\n<td>22.16 + 11.18 = 33.34</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch15-cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2397\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/M5-Ch15-cartoon.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/M5-Ch15-cartoon.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/M5-Ch15-cartoon-300x150.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>These numbers suggest that in the upcoming 7<sup>th</sup> match Billy is likely to get a score anywhere in between 19.81 and 23.39 while Mike stands to score anywhere between 10.98 and 33.34. Because Mike has a wide range, it isn’t easy to figure out if he is going to score at least 20 runs.  He can either score 10 or 34 or anything in between.</p>\n<p>However, Billy seems to be more consistent. His range is smaller, which means he will neither be a big hitter nor a lousy player. He is expected to be consistent and is likely to score anywhere between 19 and 23. In other words – selecting Mike over Billy for the 7<sup>th</sup> match can be <strong>risky</strong>.</p>\n<p>Going back to our original question, which player do you think is more likely to score at least 20 runs? By now, the answer must be clear; it has to be Billy. Billy is consistent and less risky compared to Mike.</p>\n<p>So in principle, we assessed the riskiness of these players by using “<strong>Standard Deviation</strong>”. Hence ‘Standard Deviation’ must represent ‘<strong>Risk</strong>’. In the stock market world, we define ‘Volatility’ as the riskiness of the stock or an index. Volatility is a % number as measured by the <strong>standard deviation</strong>.</p>\n<p>I’ve picked the definition of Volatility from Investopedia for you – <em>“</em><em>A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. Volatility can either be measured by using the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index. Commonly higher the standard deviation, higher is the risk”</em>.</p>\n<p>Going by the above definition,  if Infosys and TCS have the volatility of 25% and 45% respectively, then clearly Infosys has less risky price movements when compared to TCS.</p>\n<h2>15.3 – Some food for thought</h2>\n<p>Before I wrap this chapter, let’s make some prediction –<br/>\nToday’s Date = 15<sup>th</sup> July 2015<br/>\nNifty Spot = 8547<br/>\nNifty Volatility = 16.5%<br/>\nTCS Spot = 2585<br/>\nTCS Volatility = 27%</p>\n<p>Given this information, can you predict the likely range within which Nifty and TCS will trade 1 year from now?<br/>\nOf course we can, let us put the numbers to good use –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Asset</th>\n<th>Lower Estimate</th>\n<th>Upper Estimate</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nifty</td>\n<td>8547 – (16.5% * 8547) = 7136</td>\n<td>8547 + (16.5% * 8547) = 9957</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TCS</td>\n<td>2585 – (27% * 2585) = 1887</td>\n<td>2585 + (27% * 2585) = 3282</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>\n<p>So the above calculations suggest that in the next 1 year, given Nifty’s volatility, Nifty is likely to trade anywhere between <strong>7136 and 9957</strong> with all values in between having the varying probability of occurrence. This means to say on 15<sup>th</sup> July 2016 the probability of Nifty to be around 7500 could be 25%, while 8600 could be around 40%.</p>\n<p>This leads us to an exciting platform –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We estimated the range for Nifty for 1 year; similarly, can we estimate the range Nifty is likely to trade over the next few days or the range within which Nifty is likely to trade upto the series expiry?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>If we can do this, then we will be in a better position to identify options that are likely to expire worthless, meaning we could sell them today and pocket the premiums.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>We figured the range in which Nifty is likely to trade in the next 1 year as 7136 and 9957 – but how sure are we?

Before we move any further on this topic I would like to discuss how one can calculate volatility. Volatility data is not easily available, hence its always good to know how to calculate the same yourself.</p>\n<p>Of course in the previous chapter we looked into this calculation (recall the Billy &amp; Mike example), we outlined the steps as follows –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Calculate the average</li>\n<li>Calculate the deviation – Subtract the average from the actual observation</li>\n<li>Square and add up all deviations – this is called variance</li>\n<li>Calculate the square root of variance – this is called standard deviation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The purpose of doing this in the previous chapter was to show you the mechanics behind the standard deviation calculation. In my opinion it is important to know what really goes beyond a formula, it only enhances your insights. In this chapter however, we will figure out an easier way to calculate standard deviation or the volatility of a given stock using MS Excel. MS Excel uses the exact same steps we outlined above, just that it happens at a click of a button.</p>\n<p>I’ll give you the border steps involved first and then elaborate on each step –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the historical data of closing prices</li>\n<li>Calculate the daily returns</li>\n<li>Use the STDEV function</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So let us get to work straight away.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – Download the historical closing prices</p>\n<p>You can do this from any data source that you have.

The dates that I have selected here is from 22<sup>nd</sup> July 2014 to 21<sup>st</sup> July 2015.</p>\n<p>Once you hit ‘get data’, NSE’s website will query your request and fetch you the required data.

Of course along with the closing prices, you have tons of other information as well. I usually like to delete all the other unwanted data and stick to just the date and closing price. This makes the sheet look clutter free and crisp.</p>\n<p>Here is a snapshot of how my excel sheet looks at this stage –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-3_Excel.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_Excel\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2419\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"260\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-3_Excel.png\" width=\"235\"/></a></p>\n<p>Do note, I have deleted all the unnecessary information. I have retained just the date and closing prices.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – Calculate Daily Returns</p>\n<p>We know that the daily returns can be calculated as –</p>\n<p>Return = (Ending Price / Beginning Price) – 1</p>\n<p>However for all practical purposes and ease of calculation, this equation can be approximated to:</p>\n<p><strong>Return = LN (Ending Price / Beginning Price)</strong>, where LN denotes Logarithm to Base ‘e’, note this is also called ‘Log Returns’.</p>\n<p>Here is a snap shot showing you how I’ve calculated the daily log returns of WIPRO –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-4_LN-returns.png\"><img alt=\"Image 4_LN returns\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2420\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"283\" sizes=\"(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-4_LN-returns.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-4_LN-returns.png 374w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-4_LN-returns-300x227.png 300w\" width=\"374\"/></a></p>\n<p>I have used the Excel function ‘LN’ to calculate the long returns.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3 </strong>– Use the STDEV Function</p>\n<p>Once the daily returns are calculated, you can use an excel function called ‘STDEV’ to calculate the standard deviation of daily returns, which if you realize is the daily Volatility of WIPRO.</p>\n<p>Note – In order to use the STDEV function all you need to do is this –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take the cursor an empty cell</li>\n<li>Press ‘=’</li>\n<li>Follow the = sign by the function syntax i.e STDEV and open a bracket, hence the empty cell would look like =STEDEV(</li>\n<li>After the open bracket, select all the daily return data points and close the bracket</li>\n<li>Press enter</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is the snapshot which shows the same –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-5_STDEV.png\"><img alt=\"Image 5_STDEV\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2421\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"218\" sizes=\"(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-5_STDEV.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-5_STDEV.png 585w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-5_STDEV-300x112.png 300w\" width=\"585\"/></a></p>\n<p>Once this is done, Excel will instantly calculate the daily standard deviation aka volatility of WIPRO for you. I get the answer as 0.0147 which when converted to a percentage reads as 1.47%.</p>\n<p>This means the daily volatility of WIPRO is 1.47% !</p>\n<p>The value we have calculated is WIPRO’s daily volatility, but what about its annual volatility?</p>\n<p>Now here is a very important convention you will have to remember – in order to convert the daily volatility to annual volatility just multiply the daily volatility number with the square root of time.</p>\n<p>Likewise to convert the annual volatility to daily volatility, divide the annual volatility by square root of time.</p>\n<p>So in this case we have calculated the daily volatility, and we now need WIPRO’s annual volatility. We will calculate the same here –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily Volatility = 1.47%</li>\n<li>Time = 252</li>\n<li>Annual Volatility = 1.47% * SQRT (252)</li>\n<li>= 23.33%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In fact I have calculated the same on excel, have a look at the image below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot_22.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6026\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"306\" sizes=\"(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot_22.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot_22.png 551w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screenshot_22-300x167.png 300w\" width=\"551\"/></a></p>\n<p>So with this, we know WIPRO’s daily volatility is 1.47% and its annual volatility is about 23%.</p>\n<p>Lets double-check these numbers with what the NSE has published on their website. NSE publishes these numbers only for F&amp;O stocks and not other stocks. Here is the snapshot of the same –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-6_NSE.png\"><img alt=\"Image 6_NSE\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2423\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"546\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-6_NSE.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-6_NSE.png 576w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Image-6_NSE-300x284.png 300w\" width=\"576\"/></a></p>\n<p>Our calculation is pretty much close to what NSE has calculated – as per NSE’s calculation Wipro’s daily volatility is about 1.34% and Annualized Volatility is about 25.5%.</p>\n<p>So why is there a slight difference between our calculation and NSE’s? – One possible reason could be that we are using spot price while NSE is using Futures price. However, I really don’t want to get into investigating why this slight difference exists. The agenda here is to know how to calculate the volatility of the security given its daily returns.</p>\n<p>Before we wrap up this chapter, let us just do one more calculation. Assume we directly get the annual volatility of WIPRO as 25.5%, how do we figure out its daily volatility?</p>\n<p>Like I mentioned earlier, to convert annual volatility to daily volatility you simply have to divide the annual volatility by the square root of time, hence in this particular case –</p>\n<p>= 25.5% / SQRT (252)</p>\n<p>= 1.60%</p>\n<p>So far we have understood what volatility is and how to calculate the same. In the next chapter, we will understand the practical application of volatility.</p>\n<p>Do remember we are still in the process of understanding volatility; however the final objective is to understand the options greek Vega and that really means. So please do not lose sight of our end objective.</p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Wipro.xlsx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>click here</strong></a> to download the excel sheet.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Standard Deviation represents volatility, which in turn represents risk</li>\n<li>We can use NSE website to get the daily closing prices of securities</li>\n<li>Daily return can be calculated as log returns</li>\n<li>Log function in excel is LN</li>\n<li>Daily return formula = LN (Today’s Value / Yesterday’s Value) expressed as a percentage</li>\n<li>Excel function to calculate volatility is STDEV</li>\n<li>Standard Deviation of daily return is equivalent of daily volatility</li>\n<li>To convert daily volatility to annual volatility multiply the daily volatility by the square root of time</li>\n<li>Likewise to convert annual volatility to daily volatility, divide the annual volatility by the square root of time</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

We arrived at an upper and lower end range for Nifty and even concluded that Nifty is likely to trade within the calculated range.</p>\n<p>Fair enough, but how sure are we about this? Is there a possibility that Nifty would trade outside this range? If yes, what is the probability that it will trade outside the range and what is the probability that Nifty will trade within the range? If there is an outside range, then what are its values?</p>\n<p>Finding answers to these questions are very important for several reasons. If not for anything it will lay down a very basic foundation to a quantitative approach to markets, which is very different from the regular fundamental and technical analysis thought process.</p>\n<p>So let us dig a bit deeper and get our answers.</p>\n<h2>17.2 – Random Walk</h2>\n<p>The discussion we are about to have is extremely important and highly relevant to the topic at hand, and of course very interesting as well.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the image below –</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-C17-GaltonBoard1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2498\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-GaltonBoard11.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-GaltonBoard11.png 451w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-GaltonBoard11-300x266.png 300w\" width=\"451\"/></p>\n<p>What you see is called a ‘Galton Board’. A Galton Board has pins stuck to a board. Collecting bins are placed right below these pins.</p>\n<p>The idea is to drop a small ball from above the pins. Moment you drop the ball, it encounters the first pin after which the ball can either turn left or turn right before it encounters another pin. The same procedure repeats until the ball trickles down and falls into one of the bins below.</p>\n<p>Do note, once you drop the ball from top, you cannot do anything to artificially control the path that the ball takes before it finally rests in one of the bins. The path that the ball takes is completely natural and is not predefined or controlled. For this particular reason, the path that the ball takes is called the ‘<strong>Random Walk</strong>’.</p>\n<p>Now, can you imagine what would happen if you were to drop several such balls one after the other? Obviously each ball will take a random walk before it falls into one of the bins. However what do you think about the distribution of these balls in the bins?.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will they all fall in the same bin? or</li>\n<li>Will they all get distributed equally across the bins? or</li>\n<li>Will they randomly fall across the various bins?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’m sure people not familiar with this experiment would be tempted to think that the balls would fall randomly across various bins and does not really follow any particular pattern. But this does not happen, there seems to be an order here.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the image below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-GaltonBoard2.png\"><img alt=\"M5-C17-GaltonBoard2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2479\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-GaltonBoard2.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-GaltonBoard2.png 451w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-GaltonBoard2-300x266.png 300w\" width=\"451\"/></a></p>\n<p>It appears that when you drop several balls on the Galton Board, with each ball taking a random walk, they all get distributed in a particular way –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most of the balls tend to fall in the central bin</li>\n<li>As you move further away from the central bin (either to the left or right), there are fewer balls</li>\n<li>The bins at extreme ends have very few balls</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A distribution of this sort is called the “<strong>Normal Distribution</strong>”. You may have heard of the bell curve from your school days, bell curve is nothing but the normal distribution. Now here is the best part, irrespective of how many times you repeat this experiment, the balls always get distributed to form a normal distribution.</p>\n<p>This is a very popular experiment called the Galton Board experiment; I would strongly recommend you to watch this beautiful video to understand this discussion better –</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6YDHBFVIvIs\" width=\"420\"></iframe></div>\n<p>So why do you think we are discussing the Galton Board experiment and the Normal Distribution?</p>\n<p>Well many things in real life follow this natural order. For example –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gather a bunch of adults and measure their weights – segregate the weights across bins (call them the weight bins) like 40kgs to 50kgs, 50kgs to 60kgs, 60kgs to 70kgs etc. Count the number of people across each bin and you end up getting a normal distribution</li>\n<li>Conduct the same experiment with people’s height and you will end up getting a normal distribution</li>\n<li>You will get a Normal Distribution with people’s shoe size</li>\n<li>Weight of fruits, vegetables</li>\n<li>Commute time on a given route</li>\n<li>Lifetime of batteries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This list can go on and on, however I would like to draw your attention to one more interesting variable that follows the normal distribution – the daily returns of a stock!</p>\n<p>The daily returns of a stock or an index cannot be predicted – meaning if you were to ask me what will be return on TCS tomorrow I will not be able to tell you, this is more like the random walk that the ball takes. However if I collect the daily returns of the stock for a certain period and see the distribution of these returns – I get to see a normal distribution aka the bell curve!</p>\n<p>To drive this point across I have plotted the distribution of the daily returns of the following stocks/indices –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nifty (index)</li>\n<li>Bank Nifty ( index)</li>\n<li>TCS (large cap)</li>\n<li>Cipla (large cap)</li>\n<li>Kitex Garments (small cap)</li>\n<li>Astral Poly (small cap)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-3_ND-stocks.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_ND stocks\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2483\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"738\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-3_ND-stocks.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-3_ND-stocks.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-3_ND-stocks-300x277.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see the daily returns of the stocks and indices clearly follow a normal distribution.</p>\n<p>Fair enough, but I guess by now you would be curious to know why is this important and how is it connected to Volatility? Bear with me for a little longer and you will know why I’m talking about this.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch17-cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2493\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-Ch17-cartoon.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-Ch17-cartoon.png 430w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-Ch17-cartoon-300x209.png 300w\" width=\"430\"/></p>\n<h2>17.3 – Normal Distribution</h2>\n<p>I think the following discussion could be a bit overwhelming for a person exploring the concept of normal distribution for the first time. So here is what I will do – I will explain the concept of normal distribution, relate this concept to the Galton board experiment, and then extrapolate it to the stock markets. I hope this will help you grasp the gist better.</p>\n<p>So besides the Normal Distribution there are other distributions across which data can be distributed. Different data sets are distributed in different statistical ways. Some of the other data distribution patterns are – binomial distribution, uniform distribution, poisson distribution, chi square distribution etc. However the normal distribution pattern is probably the most well understood and researched distribution amongst the other distributions.</p>\n<p>The normal distribution has a set of characteristics that helps us develop insights into the data set. The normal distribution curve can be fully described by two numbers – the distribution’s mean (average) and standard deviation.</p>\n<p>The mean is the central value where maximum values are concentrated. This is the average value of the distribution. For instance, in the Galton board experiment the mean is that bin which has the maximum numbers of balls in it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-GaltonBoard32.png\"><img alt=\"M5-C17-GaltonBoard3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2508\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-GaltonBoard32.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-GaltonBoard32.png 451w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-GaltonBoard32-300x266.png 300w\" width=\"451\"/></a></p>\n<p>So if I were to number the bins (starting from the left) as 1, 2, 3…all the way upto 9 (right most), then the 5<sup>th</sup> bin (marked by a red arrow) is the ‘average’ bin. Keeping the average bin as a reference, the data is spread out on either sides of this average reference value. The way the data is spread out (dispersion as it is called) is quantified by the standard deviation (recollect this also happens to be the volatility in the stock market context).</p>\n<p>Here is something you need to know – when someone says ‘Standard Deviation (SD)’ by default they are referring to the 1<sup>st</sup> SD. Likewise there is 2<sup>nd</sup> standard deviation (2SD), 3<sup>rd</sup> standard deviation (SD) etc. So when I say SD, I’m referring to just the standard deviation value, 2SD would refer to 2 times the SD value, 3 SD would refer to 3 times the SD value so on and so forth.</p>\n<p>For example assume in case of the Galton Board experiment the SD is 1 and average is 5. Then,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 SD would encompass bins between 4<sup>th</sup> bin (5 – 1 ) and 6<sup>th</sup> bin (5 + 1). This is 1 bin to the left and 1 bin to the right of the average bin</li>\n<li>2 SD would encompass bins between 3<sup>rd</sup> bin (5 – 2*1) and 7<sup>th</sup> bin (5 + 2*1)</li>\n<li>3 SD would encompass bins between 2<sup>nd</sup> bin (5 – 3*1) and 8<sup>th</sup> bin (5 + 3*1)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now keeping the above in perspective, here is the general theory around the normal distribution which you should know –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within the 1<sup>st</sup> standard deviation one can observe 68% of the data</li>\n<li>Within the 2<sup>nd</sup> standard deviation one can observe 95% of the data</li>\n<li>Within the 3<sup>rd</sup> standard deviation one can observe 99.7% of the data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following image should help you visualize the above –</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-C17-ND-graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2502\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"250\" sizes=\"(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-ND-graph1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-ND-graph1.png 451w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/M5-C17-ND-graph1-300x166.png 300w\" width=\"451\"/></p>\n<p>Applying this to the Galton board experiment –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within the 1<sup>st</sup> standard deviation i.e between 4<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> bin we can observe that 68% of balls are collected</li>\n<li>Within the 2<sup>nd</sup> standard deviation i.e between 3<sup>rd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> bin we can observe that 95% of balls are collected</li>\n<li>Within the 3<sup>rd</sup> standard deviation i.e between 2<sup>nd</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> bin we can observe that 99.7% of balls are collected</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keeping the above in perspective, let us assume you are about to drop a ball on the Galton board and before doing so we both engage in a conversation –</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">You</strong> – I’m about to drop a ball, can you guess which bin the ball will fall into?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong> – No, I cannot as each ball takes a random walk.  However, I can predict the range of bins in which it may fall</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">You</strong> – Can you predict the range?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong> – Most probably the ball will fall between the 4<sup>th</sup> and the 6<sup>th</sup> bin</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">You</strong> – Well, how sure are you about this?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong> – I’m 68% confident that it would fall anywhere between the 4<sup>th</sup> and the 6<sup>th</sup> bin</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">You</strong> – Well, 68% is a bit low on accuracy, can you estimate the range with a greater accuracy?</p>\n<p><strong>Me</strong> – Sure, I can. The ball is likely to fall between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> bin, and I’m 95% sure about this. If you want an even higher accuracy then I’d say that the ball is likely to fall between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> bin and I’m 99.5% sure about this</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">You</strong> – Nice, does that mean there is no chance for the ball to fall in either the 1<sup>st</sup> or 10<sup>th</sup> bin?</p>\n<p><strong>Me </strong>– Well, there is certainly a chance for the ball to fall in one of the bins outside the 3<sup>rd</sup> SD bins but the chance is very low</p>\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffb05a;\">You</strong> – How low?</p>\n<p><strong>Me </strong>– The chance is as low as spotting a ‘<strong>Black Swan</strong>’ in a river.

The reason why we are talking about normal distribution is that the daily returns of the stock/indices also form a bell curve or a normal distribution. This implies that if we know the mean and standard deviation of the stock return, then we can develop a greater insight into the behavior of the stock’s returns or its dispersion.     For sake of this discussion, let us take up the case of Nifty and do some analysis.</p>\n<p>To begin with, here is the distribution of Nifty’s daily returns is –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-7_Nifty-SD.png\"><img alt=\"Image 7_Nifty SD\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2484\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"292\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-7_Nifty-SD.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-7_Nifty-SD.png 485w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-7_Nifty-SD-300x181.png 300w\" width=\"485\"/></a></p>\n<p>As we can see the daily returns are clearly distributed normally. I’ve calculated the average and standard deviation for this distribution (in case you are wondering how to calculate the same, please do refer to the previous chapter). Remember to calculate these values we need to calculate the log daily returns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daily Average / Mean = 0.04%</li>\n<li>Daily Standard Deviation / Volatility = 1.046%</li>\n<li>Current market price of Nifty = 8337</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do note, an average of 0.04% indicates that the daily returns of nifty are centered at 0.04%. Now keeping this information in perspective let us calculate the following things –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The range within which Nifty is likely to trade in the next 1 year</li>\n<li>The range within which Nifty is likely to trade over the next 30 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For both the above calculations, we will use 1 and 2 standard deviation meaning with 68% and 95% confidence.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution 1 – (Nifty’s range for next 1 year)</strong></p>\n<p>Average = 0.04%<br/>\nSD = 1.046%</p>\n<p>Let us convert this to annualized numbers –</p>\n<p>Average = 0.04*252 = 9.66%<br/>\nSD = 1.046% * Sqrt (252) = 16.61%</p>\n<p>So with 68% confidence I can say that the value of Nifty is likely to be in the range of –</p>\n<p>= Average + 1 SD (Upper Range) and Average – 1 SD (Lower Range)<br/>\n= 9.66% + 16.61% = <strong>26.66%</strong><br/>\n= 9.66% – 16.61% = <strong>-6.95%</strong></p>\n<p>Note these % are log percentages (as we have calculated this on log daily returns), so we need to convert these back to regular %, we can do that directly and get the range value (w.r.t to Nifty’s CMP of 8337) –</p>\n<p>Upper Range<br/>\n= 8337 *exponential (26.66%)<br/>\n= <strong>10841</strong></p>\n<p>And for lower range –</p>\n<p>= 8337 * exponential (-6.95%)<br/>\n= <strong>7777</strong></p>\n<p>The above calculation suggests that Nifty is likely to trade somewhere between 7777 and 10841. How confident I am about this? – Well as you know I’m 68% confident about this.</p>\n<p>Let us increase the confidence level to 95% or the 2<sup>nd</sup> standard deviation and check what values we get –</p>\n<p>Average + 2 SD (Upper Range) and Average – 2 SD (Lower Range)<br/>\n= 9.66% + 2* 16.61% = <strong>42.87%</strong><br/>\n= 9.66% – 2* 16.61% = <strong>-23.56%</strong></p>\n<p>Hence the range works out to –</p>\n<p>Upper Range<br/>\n= 8337 *exponential (42.87%)<br/>\n= <strong>12800</strong></p>\n<p>And for lower range –</p>\n<p>= 8337 * exponential (-23.56%)<br/>\n= <strong>6587</strong></p>\n<p>The above calculation suggests that with 95% confidence Nifty is likely to trade anywhere in the range of 6587 and 12800 over the next one year. Also as you can notice when we want higher accuracy, the range becomes much larger.</p>\n<p>I would suggest you do the same exercise for 99.7% confidence or with 3SD and figure out what kind of range numbers you get.</p>\n<p>Now, assume you do the range calculation of Nifty at 3SD level and get the lower range value of Nifty as 5000 (I’m just quoting this as a place holder number here), does this mean Nifty cannot go below 5000? Well it certainly can but the chance of going below 5000 is low, and if it really does go below 5000 then it can be termed as a black swan event. You can extend the same argument to the upper end range as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution 2 – (Nifty’s range for next 30 days)</strong></p>\n<p>We know the daily mean and SD –</p>\n<p>Average = 0.04%<br/>\nSD = 1.046%</p>\n<p>Since we are interested in calculating the range for next 30 days, we need to convert the same for the desired time period –</p>\n<p>Average = 0.04% * 30 = 1.15%<br/>\nSD = 1.046% * sqrt (30) = 5.73%</p>\n<p>So with 68% confidence I can say that, the value of Nifty over the next 30 days is likely to be in the range of –</p>\n<p>= Average + 1 SD (Upper Range) and Average – 1 SD (Lower Range)<br/>\n= 1.15% + 5.73% = <strong>6.88%</strong><br/>\n= 1.15% – 5.73% = <strong>– 4.58%</strong></p>\n<p>Note these % are log percentages, so we need to convert them back to regular %, we can do that directly and get the range value (w.r.t to Nifty’s CMP of 8337) –</p>\n<p>= 8337 *exponential (6.88%)<br/>\n= <strong>8930</strong></p>\n<p>And for lower range –</p>\n<p>= 8337 * exponential (-4.58%)<br/>\n= <strong>7963</strong></p>\n<p>The above calculation suggests that with 68% confidence level I can estimate Nifty to trade somewhere between 8930 and 7963 over the next 30 days.</p>\n<p>Let us increase the confidence level to 95% or the 2<sup>nd</sup> standard deviation and check what values we get –</p>\n<p>Average + 2 SD (Upper Range) and Average – 2 SD (Lower Range)<br/>\n= 1.15% + 2* 5.73% = 12.61%<br/>\n= 1.15% – 2* 5.73% = -10.31%</p>\n<p>Hence the range works out to –</p>\n<p>= 8337 *exponential (12.61%)<br/>\n= <strong>9457 </strong>(Upper Range)</p>\n<p>And for lower range –</p>\n<p>= 8337 * exponential (-10.31%)<br/>\n= <strong>7520</strong></p>\n<p>I hope the above calculations are clear to you.

I guess as such this chapter is quite long enough to accommodate more concepts. Hence we will move the application part to the next chapter. In the next chapter we will explore the applications of standard deviation (volatility) and its relevance to trading. We will discuss two important topics in the next chapter (1) How to select strikes that can be sold/written using normal distribution and (2) How to set up stoploss using volatility.</p>\n<p>Of course, do remember eventually the idea is to discuss Vega and its effect on options premium.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The daily returns of the stock is a random walk, highly difficult to predict</li>\n<li>The returns of the stock is normally distributed or rather close to normal distribution</li>\n<li>In a normal distribution the data is centered around the mean and the dispersion is measured by the standard deviation</li>\n<li>Within 1 SD we can observe 68% of the data</li>\n<li>Within 2 SD we can observe 95% of the data</li>\n<li>Within 3 SD we can observe 99.5% of the data</li>\n<li>Events occurring outside the 3<sup>rd</sup> standard deviation are referred to as Black Swan events</li>\n<li>Using the SD values we can calculate the upper and lower value of stocks/indices</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

At this stage I would like to discuss two such applications –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Selecting the right strike to short/write</li>\n<li>Calculating the stoploss for a trade</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However at a much later stage (in a different module altogether) we will explore the applications under a different topic – ‘Relative value Arbitrage (Pair Trading) and Volatility Arbitrage’. For now we will stick to trading options and futures.</p>\n<p>So let’s get started.</p>\n<p>One of the key challenges an option writer always faces is to select the right strike so that he can write that option, collect the premium, and not really be worried about the possibility of the spot moving against him. Of course, the worry of spot moving against the option writer will always exist, however a diligent trader can minimize this.</p>\n<p>Normal Distribution helps the trader minimize this worry and increase his confidence while writing options.</p>\n<p>Let’s have a quick recap –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-1_SD1.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_SD\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2572\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"263\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-1_SD1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-1_SD1.png 524w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-1_SD1-300x151.png 300w\" width=\"524\"/></a></p>\n<p>The bell curve above suggests that with reference to the mean (average) value –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>68% of the data is clustered around mean within the 1<sup>st</sup> SD, in other words there is a 68% chance that the data lies within the 1<sup>st</sup> SD</li>\n<li>95% of the data is clustered around mean within the 2<sup>nd</sup> SD, in other words there is a 95% chance that the data lies within the 2<sup>nd</sup> SD</li>\n<li>99.7% of the data is clustered around mean within the 3rd SD, in other words there is a 99.7% chance that the data lies within the 3<sup>rd</sup> SD</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since we know that Nifty’s daily returns are normally distributed, the above set of properties is applicable to Nifty. So what does it mean?</p>\n<p>This means, if we know Nifty’s mean and SD then we can pretty much make an ‘educated guess’ about the range within which Nifty is likely to trade over the selected time frame. Take this for example –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Date = 11<sup>th</sup> August 2015</li>\n<li>Number of days for expiry = 16</li>\n<li>Nifty current market price = 8462</li>\n<li>Daily Average Return = 0.04%</li>\n<li>Annualized Return = 14.8%</li>\n<li>Daily SD = 0.89%</li>\n<li>Annualized SD = 17.04%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given this I would now like to identify the range within which Nifty will trade until expiry i.e 16 days from now –</p>\n<p>16 day SD = Daily SD *SQRT (16)<br/>\n= 0.89% * SQRT (16)<br/>\n= <strong>3.567%</strong><br/>\n16 day average = Daily Avg * 16<br/>\n= 0.04% * 16 = <strong>0.65%</strong></p>\n<p>These numbers will help us calculate the upper and lower range within which Nifty is likely to trade over the next 16 days –</p>\n<p>Upper Range = 16 day Average + 16 day SD</p>\n<p>= 0.65% + 3.567%</p>\n<p>= 4.215%, to get the upper range number –</p>\n<p>= 8462 * (1+4.215%)</p>\n<p>= <strong>8818</strong></p>\n<p>Lower Range = 16 day Average – 16 day SD</p>\n<p>= 0.65% – 3.567%</p>\n<p>= 2.920% to get the lower range number –</p>\n<p>= 8462 * (1 – 2.920%)</p>\n<p>= <strong>8214</strong></p>\n<p>The calculation suggests that Nifty is likely to trade anywhere in the region of <strong>8214 to 8818. </strong>How sure are we about this, well we know that there is a 68% probability for this calculation to work in our favor. In other words there is 32% chance for Nifty to trade outside 8214 and 8818 range. This also means all strikes outside the calculated range ‘may’ go worthless.</p>\n<p>Hence –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can sell all call options above 8818 and collect the premiums because they are likely to expire worthless</li>\n<li>You can sell all put options below 8214 and collect the premiums because they are likely to expire worthless</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Alternatively if you were thinking of buying Call options above 8818 or Put options below 8214 you may want to think twice, as you now know that there is a very little chance for these options to expire in the money, hence it makes sense to avoid buying these strikes.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot of all Nifty Call option strikes above 8818 that you can choose to write (short) and collect premiums –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-2_Call-Strikes1.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_Call Strikes\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2573\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"399\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-2_Call-Strikes1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-2_Call-Strikes1.png 550w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-2_Call-Strikes1-300x218.png 300w\" width=\"550\"/></a></p>\n<p>If I were to personally select a strike today it would be either 8850 or 8900 or probably both and collect Rs.7.45 and Rs.4.85 in premium respectively. The reason to select these strikes is simple – I see an acceptable balance between risk (1 SD away) and reward (7.45 or 4.85 per lot).</p>\n<p>I’m certain many of you may have this thought – if I were to write the 8850 Call option and collect Rs.7.45 as premium, it does not really translate to any meaningful amount. After all, at Rs.7.45 per lot it translates to –</p>\n<p>= 7.45 * 25 (lot size)</p>\n<p>= Rs.186.25</p>\n<p>Well, this is exactly where many traders miss the plot. I know many who think about the gains or loss in terms of absolute value and not really in terms of return on investment.</p>\n<p>Think about it, margin amount required to take this trade is roughly Rs.12,000/-. If you are not sure about the margin requirement then I would suggest you use Zerodha’s <strong><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/margin-calculator/SPAN/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">margin calculator</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>The premium amount of Rs.186.25/- on a margin deposit of Rs.12,000/- works out to a return of 1.55%, which by any stretch on imagination is not a bad return, especially for a 16 day holding period! If you can consistently achieve this every month, then we are talking about a return of over 18% annualized just by means of option writing.</p>\n<p>I personally use this strategy to write options and I’d like to share some of my thoughts regarding this –</p>\n<p><strong>Put Options</strong> – I don’t like to short PUT options for the simple reason that panic spreads faster than greed. If there is panic in the market, the fall in market can be much quicker than you can imagine. Hence even before you can realize the OTM option that you have written can soon become ATM or ITM. Therefore it is better to avoid than regret.</p>\n<p><strong>Call Options</strong> – You inverse the above point and you will understand why writing call options are better than writing put options. For example in the Nifty example above, for the 8900 CE to become ATM or ITM Nifty has to move 438 points over 16 days. For this to happen, there has to be excess greed in the market…and like I said earlier a 438 up move takes a bit longer than 438 down move. Therefore my preference to short only call options.</p>\n<p><strong>Strike identification</strong> – I do the whole exercise of identifying the strike (SD, mean calculation, converting the same w.r.t to number days to expiry, selecting appropriate strike only the week before expiry and not before that. The timing here is deliberate</p>\n<p><strong>Timing </strong>– I prefer to short options only on the last Friday before the expiry week. For example given the August 2015 series expiry is on 27<sup>th</sup>, I’d short the call option only on 21<sup>st</sup> August around the closing. Why do I do this? This is to mainly ensure that theta works in my favor. Remember the ‘time decay’ graph we discussed in the theta chapter? The graph makes it amply evident that theta kicks in full force as we approach expiry.</p>\n<p><strong>Premium Collected – </strong>Because I write call options very close to expiry, the premiums are invariably low. The premium that I collect is around Rs.5 or 6 on Nifty Index, translating to about 1.0% return. But then I find the trade quite comforting for two reasons – (1) For the trade to work against me Nifty has to move 1 SD over 4 days, something that does not happen frequently (2) Theta works in my favor, the premiums erode much faster during the last week of expiry favoring the option seller</p>\n<p><strong>Why bother ?</strong> – Most of you may have this thought that the premiums are so low, why should I even bother? Honestly I too had this thought initially; however over time I have realized that trades with the following characteristics makes sense to me –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visibility on risk and reward – both should be quantifiable</li>\n<li>If a trade is profitable today then I should be able to replicate the same again tomorrow</li>\n<li>Consistency in finding the opportunities</li>\n<li>Assessment of worst case scenarios</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This strategy ticks well on all counts above, hence my preference.</p>\n<p><strong>SD consideration –</strong> When I’m writing options 3-4 days before expiry I prefer to write 1 SD away, however for whatever reason when I’m writing the option much earlier then I prefer to go 2 SD away. Remember higher the SD consideration, higher is the confidence level but lower is the premium that you can collect. Also, as a thumb rule I never write options when there is more than 15 days for expiry.</p>\n<p><strong>Events – </strong>I avoid writing options whenever there are important market events such as monetary policy, policy decision, corporate announcement etc. This is because the markets tend to react sharply to events and therefore a good chance of getting caught on the wrong side. Hence it is better safe than sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>Black Swan –</strong> I’m completely aware that despite all the precaution, markets can move against me and I could get caught on the wrong side. The price you pay for getting caught on the wrong side, especially for this trade is huge. Imagine you collect 5 or 6 points as premium but if you are caught on the wrong side you end up paying 15 or 20 points or more. So all the small profits you made over 9 to 10 months is given away in 1 month. In fact the legendary Satyajit Das in his highly insightful book “Traders, Guns, and Money” talks about option writing as “eating like a hen but shitting like an elephant’.</p>\n<p>The only way to make sure you minimize the impact of a black swan event is to be completely aware that it can occur anytime after you write the option. So here is my advice to you in case you decide to adopt this strategy – track the markets and gauge the market sentiment all along. The moment you sense things are going wrong be quick to exit the trade.</p>\n<p><strong>Success Ratio –</strong> Option writing keeps you on the edge of the seat. There are times when you feel that markets are going against you (fear of black swan creeps in) but only to cool off eventually. When you write options such roller coaster feelings are bound to emerge. The worst part is that during this roller coaster ride you may be forced to believe that the market is going against you (false signal) and hence you get out of a potentially profitable trade.</p>\n<p>In fact there is a very thin line between a false signal and an actual black swan event.  The way to overcome this is by developing conviction in your trades. Unfortunately I cannot teach you conviction; you will have to develop that on your own J. However your conviction improves as and when you do more of these trades (and all trades should be backed by sound reasoning and not blind guesses).</p>\n<p>Also, I personally get out of the trade when the option transitions from OTM to ATM.</p>\n<p><strong>Expenses –</strong> The key to these trades is to keep your expense to bare minimum so that you can retain maximum profits for yourself. The expenses include brokerage and applicable charges. If you short 1 lot of Nifty options and collect Rs.7 as premium then you will have to let go few points as expense. If you are trading with Zerodha, your expense will be around 1.95 for 1 lot. The higher the number of lots the lesser is your expense. So if I were trading 10 lots (with Zerodha) instead of 1, my expense drastically comes down to 0.3 points. You can use Zerodha’s <strong><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/brokerage-calculator\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">brokerage calculator</a></strong> to get the details.</p>\n<p>The cost varies broker to broker so please do make sure your broker is not greedy by charging you ridiculous brokerage fees. Even better, if you are not with Zerodha, it is about time you <strong><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/open-account\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">join us</a></strong> and become a part of our beautiful family ☺</p>\n<p><strong>Capital Allocation – </strong>An obvious question you might have at this stage – how much money do I deploy to this trade? Do I risk all my capital or only a certain %? If it’s a %, then how much would it be? There is no straight forward answer to this; hence I’ll take this opportunity to share my asset allocation technique.</p>\n<p>I’m a complete believer in equities as an asset class, so this rules out investment in Gold, Fixed Deposit, and Real Estate for me. 100% of my capital (savings) is invested in equity and equity based products. However it is advisable for any individual to diversify capital across multiple asset classes.</p>\n<p>So within Equity, here is how I split my money –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>35% of my money is invested in equity based mutual funds via SIP (systematic investment plan) route. I have further divided this across 4 funds.</li>\n<li>40% of my capital in an equity portfolio of about 12 stocks. I consider both mutual funds and equity portfolio as long term investments (5 years and beyond).</li>\n<li>25% is earmarked for short term strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The short term strategies include a bunch of trading strategies such as –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Momentum based swing trades (futures)</li>\n<li>Overnight futures/options/stock trades</li>\n<li>Intraday trades</li>\n<li>Option writing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I make sure that I do not expose more than 35% of the 25% capital for any particular strategy.  Just to make it more clear, assume I have Rs.500,000/- as my capital, here is how I would split my money –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>35% of Rs.500,000/- i.e Rs.175,000/- goes to Mutual Funds</li>\n<li>40% of Rs.500,000/- i.e Rs.200,000/- goes to equity portfolio</li>\n<li>25% of Rs.500,000/- i.e Rs.125,000/- goes to short term trading\n<ul>\n<li>35% of Rs.125,000/- i.e Rs.43,750/- is the maximum I would allocate per trade</li>\n<li>Hence I will not short more than 4 lots of options</li>\n<li>43,750/- is about 8.75% of the overall capital of Rs.500,000/-</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So this self mandated rule ensures that I do not expose more than 9% of my over all capital to any particular short term strategies including option writing.</p>\n<p><strong>Instruments </strong>– I prefer running this strategy on liquid stocks and indices. Besides Nifty and Bank Nifty I run this strategy on SBI, Infosys, Reliance, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, and TCS. I rarely venture outside this list.</p>\n<p>So here is what I would suggest you do. Run the exercise of calculating the SD and mean for Nifty, Bank Nifty on the morning of August 21<sup>st</sup> (5 to 7 days before expiry). Identify strikes that are 1 SD away from the market price and write them virtually. Wait till the expiry and experience how this trade goes. If you have the bandwidth you can run this across all the stocks that I’ve mentioned. Do this diligently for few expiries before you can deploy capital.</p>\n<p>Lastly, as a standard disclaimer I have to mention this – the thoughts expressed above suits my risk reward temperament, which could be very different from yours. Everything that I mentioned here comes from my own personal trading experience, these are not standard practices.</p>\n<p>I would suggest you note these points, understand your own risk-reward temperament, and calibrate your strategy. Hopefully the pointers here should help you develop that orientation.</p>\n<p>This is quite contradicting to this chapter but I have to recommend you to read Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s “Fooled by Randomness” at this point.  The book makes you question and rethink everything that you do in markets (and life in general). I think just being completely aware of what Taleb writes in his book along with the actions you take in markets puts you in a completely different orbit.</p>\n<h2>18.2 – Volatility based stoploss</h2>\n<p>The discussion here is a digression from Options, in fact this would have been more apt in the futures trading module, but I think we are at the right stage to discuss this topic.</p>\n<p>The first thing you need to identify before you initiate any trade is to identify the stop-loss (SL) price for the trade. As you know, the SL is a price point beyond which you will not take any further losses. For example, if you buy Nifty futures at 8300, you may identify 8200 as your stop-loss level; you will be risking 100 points on this particular trade. The moment Nifty falls below 8200, you exit the trade taking the loss. The question however is – how to identify the appropriate stop-loss level?</p>\n<p>One standard approach used by many traders is to keep a standard pre-fixed percentage stop-loss. For example one could have a 2% stop-loss on every trade. So if you are to buy a stock at Rs.500, then your stop-loss price is Rs.490 and you risk Rs.10 (2% of Rs.500) on this trade. The problem with this approach lies in the rigidity of the practice. It does not account for the daily noise / volatility of the stock. For example the nature of the stock could be such that it could swing about 2-3% on a daily basis. As a result you could be right about the direction of the trade but could still hit a ‘stop-loss’. More often than not, you would regret keeping such tight stops.</p>\n<p>An alternate and effective method to identify a stop-loss price is by estimating the stock’s volatility. Volatility accounts for the daily ‘expected’ fluctuation in the stock price. The advantage with this approach is that the daily noise of the stock is factored in.  Volatility stop is strategic as it allows us to place a stop at the price point which is outside the normal expected volatility of the stock. Therefore a volatility SL gives us the required logical exit in case the trade goes against us.</p>\n<p>Let’s understand the implementation of the volatility based SL with an example.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-3_Airtel1.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_Airtel\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2574\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"474\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-3_Airtel1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-3_Airtel1.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Image-3_Airtel1-300x178.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is the chart of Airtel forming a bullish harami, people familiar with the pattern would immediately recognize this is an opportunity to go long on the stock, keeping the low of the previous day (also coinciding with a support) as the stoploss. The target would be the immediate resistance – both S&amp;R points are marked with a blue line. Assume you expect the trade to materialize over the next 5 trading sessions. The trade details are as follows –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Long @ 395</li>\n<li>Stop-loss @ 385</li>\n<li>Target @ 417</li>\n<li>Risk = 395 – 385 = 10 or about 2.5% below entry price</li>\n<li>Reward = 417 – 385 = 32 or about 8.1% above entry price</li>\n<li>Reward to Risk Ratio = 32/10 = 3.2 meaning for every 1 point risk, the expected reward is 3.2 point</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This sounds like a good trade from a risk to reward perspective. In fact I personally consider any short term trade that has a Reward to Risk Ratio of 1.5 as a good trade. However everything hinges upon the fact that the stoploss of 385 is sensible.</p>\n<p>Let us make some calculations and dig a little deeper to figure out if this makes sense –</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Estimate the daily volatility of Airtel. I’ve done the math and the daily volatility works out to 1.8%</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Convert the daily volatility into the volatility of the time period we are interested in. To do this, we multiply the daily volatility by the square root of time. In our example, our expected holding period is 5 days, hence the 5 day volatility is equal to 1.8%*Sqrt(5).  This works out to be about 4.01%.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Calculate the stop-loss price by subtracting 4.01% (5 day volatility) from the expected entry price. 395 – (4.01% of 395) = 379. The calculation above indicates that Airtel can swing from 395 to 379 very easily over the next 5 days. This also means, a stoploss of 385 can be easily knocked down. So the SL for this trade has be a price point below 379, lets say 375, which is 20 points below the entry price of 395.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4 </strong>: With the new SL, the RRR works out to  1.6 (32/20), which still seems ok to me. Hence I would be happy to initiate the trade.</p>\n<p>Note : In case our expected holding period is 10 days, then the 10 day volatility would be 1.6*sqrt(10) so on and so forth.</p>\n<p>Pre-fixed percentage stop-loss does not factor in the daily fluctuation of the stock prices. There is a very good chance that the trader places a premature stop-loss, well within the noise levels of the stock. This invariably leads to triggering the stop-loss first and then the target.</p>\n<p>Volatility based stop-loss takes into account all the daily expected fluctuation in the stock prices. Hence if we use a stocks volatility to place our stop-loss, then we would be factoring in the noise component and in turn placing a more relevant stop loss.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use SD to identify strikes that you can write</li>\n<li>Avoid shorting PUT options</li>\n<li>Strikes 1 SD away offers 68% flexibility, if you need higher flexibility you could opt for 2SD</li>\n<li>Higher the SD, higher is the range, and lower is the premium collected</li>\n<li>Allocate capital based on your belief in asset classes.

We now know what it means, how to calculate the same, and use the volatility information for building trading strategies. It is now time to steer back to the main topic – Option Greek and in particular the 4<sup>th</sup> Option Greek “Vega”. Before we start digging deeper into Vega, we have to discuss one important topic – Quentin Tarantino ☺.</p>\n<p>I’m huge fan of Quentin Tarantino and his movies. For people not familiar with Quentin Tarantino let me tell you, he is one of the most talented directors in Hollywood. He is the man behind super cult flicks such as Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs, Django Unchained etc. If you’ve not watched his movies, I’d suggest you do, you may just love these movies as much as I do.</p>\n<p>It is a known fact that when Quentin Tarantino directs a movie, he keeps all the production details under wraps until the movies trailer hits the market. Only after the trailer is out people get to know the name of movie, star cast details, brief story line, movie location etc. However, this is not the case with the movie he is directing these days, titled “The Hateful Eight”, due to be released in December 2015. Somehow everything about ‘The Hateful Eight’ – the star cast, storyline, location etc is leaked, hence people already know what to expect from Tarantino. Now given that most of the information about the movie is already known, there are wild speculations about the box office success of his upcoming movie.</p>\n<p>We could do some analysis on this –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Past movies</strong> – We know almost all of Tarantino’s previous movies were successful. Based on his past directorial performance we can be reasonably certain that ‘The Hateful Eight’ is likely to be a box office hit</li>\n<li><strong>Movie Analyst’s forecast</strong> – There are these professional Hollywood movie analysts, who understand the business of cinema very well. Some of these analysts are forecasting that ‘The Hateful Eight’ may not do well (unlike his previous flicks) as most of the details pertaining to the movie is already, failing to enthuse the audience</li>\n<li><strong>Social Media</strong> – If you look at the discussions on ‘The Hateful Eight’ on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook, you’d realize that a lot of people are indeed excited about the movie, despite knowing what to expect from the movie. Going by the reactions on Social Media, ‘The Hateful Eight’ is likely to be a hit.</li>\n<li><strong>The actual outcome</strong> – Irrespective of what really is being expected, once the movie is released we would know if the movie is a hit or a flop. Of course this is the final verdict for which we have to wait till the movie is released.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tracking the eventual fate of the movie is not really our concern, although I’m certainly going to watch the movie ☺.</p>\n<p>Given this, you may be wondering why we are even discussing Quentin Tarantino in a chapter concerning Options and Volatility! Well this is just my attempt (hopefully not lame) to explain the different types of volatility that exist – Historical Volatility, Forecasted Volatility, and Implied Volatility. So let’s get going.</p>\n<p><strong>Historical Volatility</strong> is similar to us judging the box office success of ‘The Hateful Eight’ based on Tarantino’s past directorial ventures. In the stock market world, we take the past closing prices of the stock/index and calculate the historical volatility. Do recall, we discussed the technique of calculating the historical volatility in Chapter 16. Historical volatility is very easy to calculate and helps us with most of the day to day requirements – for instance historical volatility can ‘somewhat’ be used in the options calculator to get a ‘quick and dirty’ option price (more on this in the subsequent chapters).</p>\n<p><strong>Forecasted Volatility </strong>is similar to the movie analyst attempting to forecast the fate of ‘The Hateful Eight’. In the stock market world, analysts forecast the volatility. Forecasting the volatility refers to the act of predicting the volatility over the desired time frame.</p>\n<p>However, why would you need to predict the volatility? Well, there are many option strategies, the profitability of which solely depends on your expectation of volatility. If you have a view of volatility – for example you expect volatility to increase by 12.34% over the next 7 trading sessions, then you can set up option strategies which can profit this view, provided the view is right.</p>\n<p>Also, at this stage you should realize – to make money in the stock markets it is NOT necessary to have a view on the direction on the markets. The view can be on volatility as well. Most of the professional options traders trade based on volatility and not really the market direction. I have to mention this – many traders find forecasting volatility is far more efficient than forecasting market direction.</p>\n<p>Now clearly having a mathematical/statistical model to predict volatility is much better than arbitrarily declaring “I think the volatility is going to shoot up”. There are a few good statistical models such as ‘Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) Process’. I know it sounds spooky, but that’s what it’s called. There are several GARCH processes to forecast volatility, if you are venturing into this arena, I can straightaway tell you that GARCH (1,1) or GARCH (1,2) are better suited processes for forecasting volatility.</p>\n<p><strong>Implied Volatility (IV) </strong>is like the people’s perception on social media. It does not matter what the historical data suggests or what the movie analyst is forecasting about ‘The Hateful Eight’. People seem to be excited about the movie, and that is an indicator of how the movie is likely to fare. Likewise the implied volatility represents the market participant’s expectation on volatility. So on one hand we have the historical and forecasted volatility, both of which are sort of ‘manufactured’ while on the other hand we have implied volatility which is in a sense ‘consensual’. Implied volatility can be thought of as consensus volatility arrived amongst all the market participants with respect to the expected amount of underlying price fluctuation over the remaining life of an option. Implied volatility is reflected in the price of the premium.</p>\n<p>For this reason amongst the three different types of volatility, the IV is usually more valued.</p>\n<p>You may have heard or noticed India VIX on NSE website, India VIX is the official ‘Implied Volatility’ index that one can track. India VIX is computed based on a mathematical formula, here is a <strong><a href=\"https://www1.nseindia.com/content/indices/white_paper_IndiaVIX.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">whitepaper</a></strong> which explains how India VIX is calculated –</p>\n<p>If you find the computation a bit overwhelming, then here is a quick wrap on what you need to know about India VIX (<em>I have reproduced some of these points from the NSE’s whitepaper</em>) –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>NSE computes India VIX based on the order book of Nifty Options</li>\n<li>The best bid-ask rates for near month and next-month Nifty options contracts are used for computation of India VIX</li>\n<li>India VIX indicates the investor’s perception of the market’s volatility in the near term (next 30 calendar days)</li>\n<li>Higher the India VIX values, higher the expected volatility and vice-versa</li>\n<li>When the markets are highly volatile, market tends to move steeply and during such time the volatility index tends to rise</li>\n<li>Volatility index declines when the markets become less volatile. Volatility indices such as India VIX are sometimes also referred to as the ‘Fear Index’, because as the volatility index rises, one should become careful, as the markets can move steeply into any direction. Investors use volatility indices to gauge the market volatility and make their investment decisions</li>\n<li>Volatility Index is different from a market index like NIFTY. NIFTY measures the direction of the market and is computed using the price movement of the underlying stocks whereas India VIX measures the expected volatility and is computed using the order book of the underlying NIFTY options. While Nifty is a number, India VIX is denoted as an annualized percentage</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Further, NSE publishes the implied volatility for various strike prices for all the options that get traded. You can track these implied volatilities by checking the option chain. For example here is the option chain of Cipla, with all the IV’s marked out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_IV.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_IV\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2585\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"428\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_IV.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_IV.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_IV-300x161.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The Implied Volatilities can be calculated using a standard options calculator. We will discuss more about calculating IV, and using IV for setting up trades in the subsequent chapters. For now we will now move over to understand Vega.</p>\n<p><strong>Realized Volatility</strong> is pretty much similar to the eventual outcome of the movie, which we would get to know only after the movie is released. Likewise the realized volatility is looking back in time and figuring out the actual volatility that occurred during the expiry series. Realized volatility matters especially if you want to compare today’s implied volatility with respect to the historical implied volatility. We will explore this angle in detail when we take up “Option Trading Strategies”.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch19-cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2584\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/M5-Ch19-cartoon.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/M5-Ch19-cartoon.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/M5-Ch19-cartoon-300x150.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>19.2 – Vega</h2>\n<p>Have you noticed this – whenever there are heavy winds and thunderstorms, the electrical voltage in your house starts fluctuating violently, and with the increase in voltage fluctuations, there is a chance of a voltage surge and therefore the electronic equipments at house may get damaged.</p>\n<p>Similarly, when volatility increases, the stock/index price starts swinging heavily. To put this in perspective, imagine a stock is trading at Rs.100, with increase in volatility, the stock can start moving anywhere between 90 and 110. So when the stock hits 90, all PUT option writers start sweating as the Put options now stand a good chance of expiring in the money. Similarly, when the stock hits 110, all CALL option writers would start panicking as all the Call options now stand a good chance of expiring in the money.</p>\n<p>Therefore irrespective of Calls or Puts when volatility increases, the option premiums have a higher chance to expire in the money. Now, think about this – imagine you want to write 500 CE options when the spot is trading at 475 and 10 days to expire. Clearly there is no intrinsic value but there is some time value. Hence assume the option is trading at Rs.20. Would you mind writing the option? You may write the options and pocket the premium of Rs.20/- I suppose. However, what if the volatility over the 10 day period is likely to increase – maybe election results or corporate results are scheduled at the same time. Will you still go ahead and write the option for Rs.20? Maybe not, as you know with the increase in volatility, the option can easily expire ‘in the money’ hence you may lose all the premium money you have collected. If all option writers start fearing the volatility, then what would compel them to write options? Clearly, a higher premium amount would. Therefore instead of Rs.20, if the premium was 30 or 40, you may just think about writing the option I suppose.</p>\n<p>In fact this is exactly what goes on when volatility increases (or is expected to increase) – option writers start fearing that they could be caught writing options that can potentially transition to ‘in the money’. But nonetheless, fear too can be overcome for a price, hence option writers expect higher premiums for writing options, and therefore the premiums of call and put options go up when volatility is expected to increase.</p>\n<p>The graphs below emphasizes the same point –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-2_CE.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_CE\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2586\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"370\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-2_CE.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-2_CE.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-2_CE-300x139.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-3_PE.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_PE\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2587\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"370\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-3_PE.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-3_PE.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-3_PE-300x139.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>X axis represents Volatility (in %) and Y axis represents the premium value in Rupees.  Clearly, as we can see, when the volatility increases, the premiums also increase. This holds true for both call and put options. The graphs here go a bit further, it shows you the behavior of option premium with respect to change in volatility and the number of days to expiry.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the first chart (CE), the blue line represents the change in premium with respect to change in volatility when there is 30 days left for expiry, likewise the green and red line represents the change in premium with respect to change in volatility when there is 15 days left and 5 days left for expiry respectively.</p>\n<p>Keeping this in perspective, here are a few observations (observations are common for both Call and Put options) –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Referring to the Blue line – when there are 30 days left for expiry (start of the series) and the volatility increases from 15% to 30%, the premium increases from 97 to 190, representing about 95.5% change in premium</li>\n<li>Referring to the Green line – when there are 15 days left for expiry (mid series) and the volatility increases from 15% to 30%, the premium increases from 67 to 100, representing about 50% change in premium</li>\n<li>Referring to the Red line – when there are 5 days left for expiry (towards the end of series) and the volatility increases from 15% to 30%, the premium increases from 38 to 56, representing about 47% change in premium</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keeping the above observations in perspective, we can make few deductions –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The graphs above considers a 100% increase of volatility from 15% to 30% and its effect on the premiums. The idea is to capture and understand the behavior of increase in volatility with respect to premium and time. Please be aware that observations hold true even if the volatility moves by smaller amounts like maybe 20% or 30%, its just that the respective move in the premium will be proportional</li>\n<li>The effect of Increase in volatility is maximum when there are more days to expiry – this means if you are at the start of series, and the volatility is high then you know premiums are plum. Maybe a good idea to write these options and collect the premiums – invariably when volatility cools off, the premiums also cool off and you could pocket the differential in premium</li>\n<li>When there are few days to expiry and the volatility shoots up the premiums also goes up, but not as much as it would when there are more days left for expiry. So if you are a wondering why your long options are not working favorably in a highly volatile environment, make sure you look at the time to expiry</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So at this point one thing is clear – with increase in volatility, the premiums increase, but the question is ‘by how much?’. This is exactly what the Vega tells us.</p>\n<p>The Vega of an option measures the rate of change of option’s value (premium) with every percentage change in volatility. Since options gain value with increase in volatility, the vega is a positive number, for both calls and puts. For example – if the option has a vega of 0.15, then for each % change in volatility, the option will gain or lose 0.15 in its theoretical value.</p>\n<h2>19.3 – Taking things forward</h2>\n<p>It is now perhaps time to revisit the path this module on Option Trading has taken and will take going forward (over the next few chapters).</p>\n<p>We started with the basic understanding of the options structure and then proceeded to understand the Call and Put options from both the buyer and sellers perspective. We then moved forward to understand the moneyness of options and few basic technicalities with respect to options.</p>\n<p>We further understood option Greeks such as the Delta, Gamma, Theta, and Vega along with a mini series of Normal Distribution and Volatility.</p>\n<p>At this stage, our understanding on Greeks is one dimensional. For example we know that as and when the market moves the option premiums move owing to delta. But in reality, there are several factors that works simultaneously – on one hand we can have the markets moving heavily, at the same time volatility could be going crazy, liquidity of the options getting sucked in and out, and all of this while the clock keeps ticking. In fact this is exactly what happens on an everyday basis in markets. This can be a bit overwhelming for newbie traders. It can be so overwhelming that they quickly rebrand the markets as ‘Casino’. So the next time you hear someone say such a thing about the markets, make sure you point them to Varsity ☺.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the point that I wanted to make is that all these Greeks manifest itself on the premiums and therefore the premiums vary on a second by second basis. So it becomes extremely important for the trader to fully understand these ‘inter Greek’ interactions of sorts. This is exactly what we will do in the next chapter. We will also have a basic understanding of the Black &amp; Scholes options pricing formula and how to use the same.</p>\n<h2>19.4 – Flavors of Inter Greek Interactions</h2>\n<p>(The following article was featured in <strong><a href=\"http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/technically/when-options-strike/article7596687.ece\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Business Line</a></strong> dated 31st August 2015)</p>\n<p>Here is something that happened very recently.

In fact most of the call option premiums (strikes below 8600) did decline in value but option strikes above 8650 behaved differently – their premium as opposed to the general expectation did not decline, rather increased by 50-80%. This move has perplexed many traders, with many of the traders attributing this move to random theories such as rate rigging, market manipulation, technological inefficiency, liquidity issues etc. But I suspect any of this is true; in fact this can be explained based on the option theory logic.</p>\n<p>We know that option premiums are influenced by sensitivity factors aka the Option Greeks. Delta as we know captures the sensitivity of options premium with respect to the movement of the underlying. Here is a quick recap – if the Delta of a particular call option is 0.75, then for every 1 point increase/decrease in the underlying the premium is expected to increase/decrease by 0.75 points. On 24<sup>th</sup> August, Nifty declined by 490 points, so all call options which had ‘noticeable Delta’ (like 0.2, 0.3, 0.6 etc) declined. Typically ‘in the money’ options (as on 24<sup>th</sup> Aug, all strike below 8600) tend to have noticeable Delta, therefore all their premiums declined with the decline in the underlying.</p>\n<p>‘Out of the money’ options usually have a very low delta like 0.1 or lower. This means, irrespective of the move in the underlying the moment in the option premium will be very restrictive. As on August 24<sup>th</sup>, all options above 8600 were ‘out of the money’ options with low delta values. Hence irrespective of the massive fall in the market, these call options did not lose much premium value.</p>\n<p>The above explains why certain call options did not lose value, but why did the premiums go up? The answer to this is lies in Vega – the option Greek which captures the sensitivity of market volatility on options premiums.</p>\n<p>With increase in volatility, the Vega of an option increases (irrespective of calls and puts), and with increase in Vega, the option premium tends to increase. On 24<sup>th</sup> August the volatility of Indian markets shot up by 64%. This increase in volatility was totally unexpected by the market participants. With the increase in volatility, the Vega of all options increases, thereby their respective premiums also increased. The effect of Vega is particularly high for ‘Out of the money’ options.  So on one hand the low delta value of ‘out of the money’ call options prevented the option premiums from declining while on the other hand, high Vega value increased the option premium for these out of the money options.</p>\n<p>Hence on 24<sup>th</sup> August 2015 we got to witness the unusual – call option premium increasing 50 – 80% on a day when markets crashed 5.92%.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Historical Volatility is measured by the closing prices of the stock/index</li>\n<li>Forecasted Volatility is forecasted by volatility forecasting models</li>\n<li>Implied Volatility represents the market participants expectation of volatility</li>\n<li>India VIX represents the implied volatility over the next 30 days period</li>\n<li>Vega measures the rate of change of premium with respect to change in volatility</li>\n<li>All options increase in premium when volatility increases</li>\n<li>The effect of volatility is highest when there are more days left for expiry</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

This is an area we need to explore in more detail, as it will help us select the right strikes to trade. However before we do that we will touch upon two topics related to volatility called ‘Volatility Smile’ and ‘Volatility Cone’.</p>\n<p>Volatility Smile is an interesting concept, something that I consider ‘good to know’ kind of concept. For this reason I will just touch upon this and not really dig deeper into it.</p>\n<p>Theoretically speaking, all options of the same underlying, expiring on the same expiry day should display similar ‘Implied Volatilities’ (IV). However in reality this does not happen.</p>\n<p>Have a look at this image –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_Vol-smile.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_Vol smile\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2616\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"456\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_Vol-smile.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_Vol-smile.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_Vol-smile-300x171.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is the option chain of SBI as of 4<sup>th</sup> September 2015. SBI is trading around 225, hence the 225 strike becomes ‘At the money’ option, and the same is highlighted with a blue band. The two green bands highlight the implied volatilities of all the other strikes. Notice this – as you go away from the ATM option (for both Calls and Puts) the implied volatilities increase, in fact  further you move from ATM, the higher is the IV. You can notice this pattern across all the different stocks/indices. Further you will also observe that the implied volatility of the ATM option is the lowest. If you plot a graph of all the options strikes versus their respective implied volatility you will get to see a graph similar to the one below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-2_Vol-smile.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_Vol smile\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2624\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-2_Vol-smile.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-2_Vol-smile.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-2_Vol-smile-300x150.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>The graph appears like a pleasing smile; hence the name ‘Volatility Smile’ ☺</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>20.2 – Volatility Cone</h2>\n<p>(<em>All the graphs in this chapter and in this section on Volatility Cone has been authored by <a href=\"https://in.linkedin.com/in/prakashlekkala\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prakash Lekkala</a>)</em></p>\n<p>So far we have not touched upon an option strategy called ‘Bull Call Spread’, but for the sake of this discussion I will make an assumption that you are familiar with this strategy.</p>\n<p>For an options trader, implied volatility of the options greatly affects the profitability. Consider this – you are bullish on stock and want to initiate an option strategy such as a Bull Call Spread. If you initiate the trade when the implied volatility of options is high, then you will have to incur high upfront costs and lower profitability potential. However if you initiate the position when the option implied volatility is low, your trading position will incur lower costs and higher potential profit.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-ch20-cartoon2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2614\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/M5-ch20-cartoon2.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/M5-ch20-cartoon2.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/M5-ch20-cartoon2-300x150.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/>For instance as of today, Nifty is trading at 7789. Suppose the current implied volatility of option positions is 20%, then a 7800 CE and 8000 CE bull call spread would cost 72 with a potential profit of 128. However if the implied volatility is 35% instead of 20%, the same position would cost 82 with potential profit of 118. Notice with higher volatility a bull call spread not only costs higher but the profitability greatly reduces.</p>\n<p>So the point is for option traders , it becomes extremely crucial to assess the level of volatility in order to time the trade accordingly. Another problem an option trader has to deal with is, the selection of the underlying and the strike (particularly true if your strategies are volatility based).</p>\n<p>For example – Nifty ATM options currently have an IV of ~25%, whereas SBI ATM options have an IV of ~52%, given this should you choose to trade Nifty options because IV is low or should you go with SBI options?</p>\n<p>This is where the Volatility cone comes handy – it addresses these sorts of questions for Option traders. Volatility Cone helps the trader to evaluate the costliness of an option i.e. identify options which are trading costly/cheap. The good news is, you can do it not only across different strikes of a security but also across different securities as well.</p>\n<p>Let’s figure out how to use the Volatility Cone.</p>\n<p>Below is a Nifty chart for the last 15 months. The vertical lines mark the expiry dates of the derivative contracts, and the boxes prior to the vertical lines mark the price movement of Nifty 10 days prior to expiry.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-3_-Nifty.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_ Nifty\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2617\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"193\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-3_-Nifty.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-3_-Nifty.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-3_-Nifty-300x72.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>If you calculate the Nifty’s realized volatility in each of the boxes, you will get the following table –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Expiry Date</th>\n<th>Annualized realized volatility</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jun-14</td>\n<td>41%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jul-14</td>\n<td>38%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aug-14</td>\n<td>33%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sep-14</td>\n<td>28%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oct-14</td>\n<td>28%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Nov-14</td>\n<td>41%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Dec-14</td>\n<td>26%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jan-15</td>\n<td>22%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Feb-15</span></td>\n<td>56%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mar-15</td>\n<td>19%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"background-color: #ffaf59;\">Apr-15</span></td>\n<td>13%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>May-15</td>\n<td>34%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jun-15</td>\n<td>17%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Jul-15</td>\n<td>41%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aug-15</td>\n<td>21%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>From the above table we can observe that Nifty’s realized volatility has ranged from a maximum of 56% (Feb 2015) to a minimum of 13% (April 2015).</p>\n<p>We can also calculate mean and variance of the realized volatility, as shown below –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Particulars</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maximum Volatility</td>\n<td>56%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+2 Standard Deviation (SD)</td>\n<td>54%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+1 Standard Deviation (SD)</td>\n<td>42%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mean/ Average Volatility</td>\n<td>31%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-1 Standard Deviation (SD)</td>\n<td>19%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-2 Standard Deviation (SD)</td>\n<td>7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minimum Volatility</td>\n<td>13%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If we repeat this exercise for 10, 20, 30, 45, 60 &amp; 90 day windows, we would get a table as follows –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Days to Expiry</th>\n<th>10</th>\n<th>20</th>\n<th>30</th>\n<th>45</th>\n<th>60</th>\n<th>90</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max</td>\n<td>56%</td>\n<td>49%</td>\n<td>41%</td>\n<td>40%</td>\n<td>37%</td>\n<td>35%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+2 SD</td>\n<td>54%</td>\n<td>46%</td>\n<td>42%</td>\n<td>41%</td>\n<td>40%</td>\n<td>38%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>+1 SD</td>\n<td>42%</td>\n<td>38%</td>\n<td>36%</td>\n<td>36%</td>\n<td>35%</td>\n<td>33%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mean/Average</td>\n<td>30%</td>\n<td>29%</td>\n<td>30%</td>\n<td>30%</td>\n<td>30%</td>\n<td>29%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-1 SD</td>\n<td>19%</td>\n<td>21%</td>\n<td>23%</td>\n<td>24%</td>\n<td>24%</td>\n<td>24%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-2 SD</td>\n<td>7%</td>\n<td>13%</td>\n<td>17%</td>\n<td>19%</td>\n<td>19%</td>\n<td>19%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Min</td>\n<td>13%</td>\n<td>16%</td>\n<td>21%</td>\n<td>22%</td>\n<td>21%</td>\n<td>20%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The graphical representation of the table above would look like a cone as shown below, hence the name ‘Volatility Cone’ –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-4_VC.png\"><img alt=\"Image 4_VC\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2618\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"359\" sizes=\"(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-4_VC.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-4_VC.png 527w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-4_VC-300x204.png 300w\" width=\"527\"/></a></p>\n<p>The way to read the graph would be to first identify the ‘Number of days to Expiry’ and then look at all the data points that are plotted right above it. For example if the number of days to expiry is 30, then observe the data points (representing realized volatility) right above it to figure out the ‘Minimum, -2SD, -1 SD, Average implied volatility etc’. Also, do bear in mind; the ‘Volatility Cone’ is a graphical representation on the ‘historical realized volatility’.</p>\n<p>Now that we have built the volatility cone, we can plot the current day’s implied volatility on it. The graph below shows the plot of Nifty’s near month (September 2015) and next month (October 2015) implied volatility on the volatility cone.</p>\n<p>Each dot represents the implied volatility for an option contract – blue are for call options and black for put options.</p>\n<p>For example starting from left, look at the first set of dots – there are 3 blue and black dots. Each dot represents an implied volatility of an option contract – so the first blue dot from bottom could be the implied volatility of 7800 CE, above that it could be the implied volatility of 8000 CE and above that it could be the implied volatility of 8100 PE etc.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-5_Overlap1.png\"><img alt=\"Image 5_Overlap\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2628\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"356\" sizes=\"(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-5_Overlap1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-5_Overlap1.png 527w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-5_Overlap1-300x203.png 300w\" width=\"527\"/></a></p>\n<p>Do note the first set of dots (starting form left) represent near month options (September 2015) and are plotted at 12 on x-axis, i.e. these options will expire 12 days from today. The next set of dots is for middle month (October 2015) plotted at 43, i.e. these options will expire 43 days from today.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Interpretation</u></strong></p>\n<p>Look at the 2nd set of dots from left. We can notice a blue dot above the +2SD line (top most line, colored in maroon) for middle month option. Suppose this dot is for option 8200 CE, expiring 29-Oct-2015, then it means that today 8200 CE is experiencing an implied volatility, which is higher (by +2SD) than the volatility experienced in this stock whenever there are “43 days to expiry” over the last 15 months [remember we have considered data for 15 months]. Therefore this option has a high IV, hence the premiums would be high and one can consider designing a trade to short the ‘volatility’ with an expectation that the volatility will cool off.</p>\n<p>Similarly a black dot near -2 SD line on the graph, is for a Put option. It suggests that, this particular put option has very low IV, hence low premium and therefore it could be trading cheap. One can consider designing a trade so as to buy this put option.</p>\n<p>A trader can plot volatility cone for stocks and overlap it with the option’s current IV. In a sense, the volatility cone helps us develop an insight about the state of current implied volatility with respect to the past realized volatility.</p>\n<p>Those options which are close to + 2SD line are trading costly and options near -2 SD line are considered to be trading cheap. Trader can design trades to take advantage of ‘mispriced’ IV. In general, try to short options which are costlier and go long on options which are trading cheap.</p>\n<p>Please note: Use the plot only for options which are liquid.</p>\n<p>With this discussion on Volatility Smile and Volatility Cone, hopefully our understanding on Volatility has come to a solid ground.</p>\n<h2>20.3 – Gamma vs Time</h2>\n<p>Over the next two sections let us focus our attention to inter greek interactions.</p>\n<p>Let us now focus a bit on greek interactions, and to begin with we will look into the behavior of Gamma with respect to time. Here are a few points that will help refresh your memory on Gamma –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gamma measures the rate of change of delta</li>\n<li>Gamma is always a positive number for both Calls and Puts</li>\n<li>Large Gamma can translate to large gamma risk (directional risk)</li>\n<li>When you buy options (Calls or Puts) you are long Gamma</li>\n<li>When you short options (Calls or Puts) you are short Gamma</li>\n<li>Avoid shorting options which have a large gamma</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last point says – avoid shorting options which have a large gamma. Fair enough, however imagine this – you are at a stage where you plan to short an option which has a small gamma value. The idea being you short the low gamma option and hold the position till expiry so that you get to keep the entire option premium. The question however is, how do we ensure the gamma is likely to remain low throughout the life of the trade?</p>\n<p>The answer to this lies in understanding the behavior of Gamma versus time to expiry/maturity. Have a look at the graph below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-6_Gamma-vs-Time2.png\"><img alt=\"Image 6_Gamma vs Time\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2629\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"369\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-6_Gamma-vs-Time2.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-6_Gamma-vs-Time2.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-6_Gamma-vs-Time2-300x138.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The graph above shows how the gamma of ITM, ATM, and OTM options behave as the ‘time to expiry’ starts to reduce. The Y axis represents gamma and the X axis represents time to expiry. However unlike other graphs, don’t look at the X – axis from left to right, instead look at the X axis from right to left. At extreme right, the value reads 1, which suggests that there is ample time to expiry. The value at the left end reads 0, meaning there is no time to expiry. The time lapse between 1 and 0 can be thought of as any time period – 30 days to expiry, 60 days to expiry, or 365 days to expiry. Irrespective of the time to expiry, the behavior of gamma remains the same.</p>\n<p>The graph above drives across these points –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When there is ample time to expiry, all three options ITM, ATM, OTM have low Gamma values. ITM option’s Gamma tends to be lower compared to ATM or OTM options</li>\n<li>The gamma values for all three strikes (ATM, OTM, ITM) remain fairly constant till they are half way through the expiry</li>\n<li>ITM and OTM options race towards zero gamma as we approach expiry</li>\n<li>The gamma value of ATM options shoot up drastically as we approach expiry</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From these points it is quite clear that, you really do not want to be shorting “ATM” options, especially close to expiry as  ATM Gamma tends to be very high.</p>\n<p>In fact if you realize we are simultaneously talking about 3 variables here – Gamma, Time to expiry, and Option strike. Hence visualizing the change in one variable with respect to change in another makes sense. Have a look at the image below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-7_Gamma-vs-Time1.png\"><img alt=\"Image 7_Gamma vs Time\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2630\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"465\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-7_Gamma-vs-Time1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-7_Gamma-vs-Time1.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-7_Gamma-vs-Time1-300x233.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>The graph above is called a ‘Surface Plot’, this is quite useful to observe the behavior of 3 or more variables. The X-axis contains ‘Time to Expiry’ and the ‘Y axis’ contains the gamma value. There is another axis which contains ‘Strike’.</p>\n<p>There are a few red arrows plotted on the surface plot. These arrows are placed to indicate that each line that the arrow is pointing to, refers to different strikes. The outermost line (on either side) indicates OTM and ITM strikes, and the line at the center corresponds to ATM option. From these lines it is very clear that as we approach expiry, the gamma values of all strikes except ATM tends to move towards zero. The ATM and few strikes around ATM have non zero gamma values. In fact Gamma is highest for the line at the center – which represents ATM option.</p>\n<p>We can look at it from the perspective of the strike price –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-8_Strikes1.png\"><img alt=\"Image 8_Strikes\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2631\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"410\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-8_Strikes1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-8_Strikes1.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-8_Strikes1-300x205.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is the same graph but shown from a different angle, keeping the strike in perspective. As we can see, the gamma of ATM options shoot up while the Gamma of other option strikes don’t.</p>\n<p>In fact here is a 3D rendering of Gamma versus Strike versus Time to Expiry.

The fact that 6800 PE is trading at 8.3 implies there are a bunch of traders who expect the market to move 1100 points lower within 11 trading sessions (do note there are also 2 trading holidays from now to expiry).</p>\n<p>Given the odds of Nifty moving 1100 (14% lower from present level) in 11 trading sessions are low, why is the 6800 PE trading at 8.3? Is there something else driving the options prices higher besides pure expectations? Well, the following graph may just have the answer for you –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-10_Delta-vs-Volatility-2.png\"><img alt=\"Image 10_Delta vs Volatility-2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2625\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"300\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-10_Delta-vs-Volatility-2.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-10_Delta-vs-Volatility-2.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-10_Delta-vs-Volatility-2-300x150.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>The graph represents the movement of Delta with respect to strike price. Here is what you need to know about the graph above –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The blue line represents the delta of a call option, when the implied volatility is 20%</li>\n<li>The red line represents the delta of a call option, when the implied volatility is 40%</li>\n<li>The green line represents the delta of a Put option, when the implied volatility is 20%</li>\n<li>The purple line represents the delta of a Put option, when the implied volatility is 40%</li>\n<li>The call option Delta varies from 0 to 1</li>\n<li>The Put option Delta varies from 0 to -1</li>\n<li>Assume the current stock price is 175, hence 175 becomes ATM option</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the above points in mind, let us now understand how these deltas behave –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Starting from left – observe the blue line (CE delta when IV is 20%), considering 175 is the ATM option, strikes such as 135, 145 etc are all Deep ITM. Clearly Deep ITM options have a delta of 1</li>\n<li>When IV is low (20%), the delta gets flattened at the ends (deep OTM and ITM options). This implies that the rate at which Delta moves (further implying the rate at which the option premium moves) is low. In other words deep ITM options tends to behave exactly like a futures contract (when volatility is low) and OTM option prices will be close to zero.</li>\n<li>You can observe similar behavior for Put option with low volatility (observe the green line)</li>\n<li>Look at the red line (delta of CE when volatility is 40%) – we can notice that the end (ITM/OTM) is not flattened, in fact the line appears to be more reactive to underlying price movement. In other words, the rate at which the option’s premium change with respect to change in underlying is high, when volatility is high. In other words, a large range of options around ATM are sensitive to spot price changes, when volatility is high.</li>\n<li>Similar observation can be made for the Put options when volatility is high (purple line)</li>\n<li>Interestingly when the volatility is low (look at the blue and green line) the delta of OTM options goes to almost zero. However when the volatility is high, the delta of OTM never really goes to zero and it maintains a small non zero value.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, going back to the initial thought – why is the 6800 PE, which is 1100 points away trading at Rs.8.3/-?</p>\n<p>Well that’s because 6800 PE is a deep OTM option, and as the delta graph above suggests, when the volatility is high (see image below), deep OTM options have non zero delta value.</p>\n<p>I would suggest you draw your attention to the Delta versus IV graph and in particular look at the Call Option delta when implied volatility is high (maroon line). As we can see the delta does not really collapse to zero (like the blue line – CE delta when IV is low). This should explain why the premium is not really low. Further add to this the fact that there is sufficient time value, the OTM option tends to have a ‘respectable’ premium.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-11_-India-Vix_Sept11.png\"><img alt=\"Image 11_ India Vix_Sept11\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2623\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"306\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-11_-India-Vix_Sept11.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-11_-India-Vix_Sept11.png 341w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-11_-India-Vix_Sept11-300x269.png 300w\" width=\"341\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Volatility-cone.xlsx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Download</a></strong> the Volatility Cone excel.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Volatility smile helps you visualize the fact that the OTM options usually have high IVs</li>\n<li>With the help of a ‘Volatility Cone’ you can visualize today’s implied volatility with respect to past realized volatility</li>\n<li>Gamma is high for ATM option especially towards the end of expiry</li>\n<li>Gamma for ITM and OTM options goes to zero when we approach expiry</li>\n<li>Delta has an effect on lower range of options around ATM when IV is low and its influence increases when volatility is high.</li>\n<li>When the volatility is high, the far OTM options do tend to have a non zero delta value</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

It is now time to understand how to calculate these Greeks using the Black &amp; Scholes (BS) Options pricing calculator. The BS options pricing calculator is based on the Black and Scholes options pricing model, which was first published by Fisher Black and Myron Scholes (hence the name Black &amp; Scholes) in 1973, however Robert C Merton developed the model and brought in a full mathematical understanding to the pricing formula.</p>\n<p>This particular pricing model is highly revered in the financial market, so much so that both Robert C Merton and Myron Scholes received the 1997 Noble Prize for Economic Sciences. The B&amp;S options pricing model involves mathematical concepts such as partial differential equations, normal distribution, stochastic processes etc. The objective in this module is not to take you through the math in B&amp;S model; in fact you could look at this video from Khan Academy for the same –</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pr-u4LCFYEY\" width=\"560\"></iframe></div>\n<p>My objective is to take you through the practical application of the Black &amp; Scholes options pricing formula.</p>\n<h2>21.2 – Overview of the model</h2>\n<p>Think of the BS calculator as a black box, which takes in a bunch of inputs and gives out a bunch of outputs. The inputs required are mostly market data of the options contract and the outputs are the Option Greeks.</p>\n<p>The framework for the pricing model works like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We input the model with Spot price, Strike price, Interest rate, Implied volatility, Dividend, and Number of days to expiry</li>\n<li>The pricing model churns out the required mathematical calculation and gives out a bunch of outputs</li>\n<li>The output includes all the Option Greeks and the theoretical price of the call and put option for the strike selected</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The illustration below gives the schema of a typical options calculator:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-C21-Illustration\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2673\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"467\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-C21-Illustration.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-C21-Illustration.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-C21-Illustration-300x175.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></p>\n<p>On the input side:</p>\n<p><strong>Spot price</strong> – This is the spot price at which the underlying is trading. Note we can even replace the spot price with the futures price. We use the futures price when the option contract is based on futures as its underlying. Usually the commodity and in some cases the currency options are based on futures. For equity option contacts always use the spot price.</p>\n<p><strong>Interest Rate</strong> – This is risk free rate prevailing in the economy. Use the RBI 91 day Treasury bill rate for this purpose. You can get the rate from the RBI website, RBI has made it available on their landing page, as highlighted below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_91Tbill.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_91Tbill\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2662\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"399\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_91Tbill-1024x511.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_91Tbill-1024x511.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_91Tbill-300x150.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-1_91Tbill.png 1076w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>As of September 2015 the prevailing rate is 7.4769% per annum.</p>\n<p><strong>Dividend </strong>– This is the dividend per share expected in the stock, provided the stock goes ex dividend within the expiry period. For example, assume today is 11<sup>th</sup> September and you wish to calculate the Option Greeks for the ICICI Bank option contract. Assume ICICI Bank is going ex dividend on 18<sup>th</sup> Sept with a dividend of Rs.4. The expiry for the September series is 24<sup>th</sup> September 2015, hence the dividend would be Rs.4. in this case.</p>\n<p><strong>Number of days to expiry</strong> – This the number of calendar days left to expiry</p>\n<p><strong>Volatility </strong>– This is where you need to enter the option’s implied volatility. You can always look at the option chain provided by NSE to extract the implied volatility data. For example, here is the snap shot of ICICI Bank’s 280 CE, and as we can see, the IV for this contract is 43.55%.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-2_IV.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_IV\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2663\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"424\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-2_IV.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-2_IV.png 1007w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Image-2_IV-300x159.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Let us use this information to calculate the option Greeks for ICICI 280 CE.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spot Price = 272.7</li>\n<li>Interest Rate = 7.4769%</li>\n<li>Dividend = 0</li>\n<li>Number of days to expiry = 1 (today is 23<sup>rd</sup> September, and expiry is on 24<sup>th</sup> September)</li>\n<li>Volatility = 43.55%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once we have this information, we need to feed this into a standard Black &amp; Scholes Options calculator.

This is the theoretical option price as per the B&amp;S options calculator. Ideally this should match with the current option price in the market</li>\n<li>Below the premium values, all the Options Greeks are listed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’m assuming that by now you are fairly familiar with what each of the Greeks convey, and the application of the same.</p>\n<p>One last note on option calculators – the option calculator is mainly used to calculate the Option Greeks and the theoretical option price. Sometimes small difference arises owing to variations in input assumptions. Hence for this reason, it is good to have room for the inevitable modeling errors. However by and large, the option calculator is fairly accurate.</p>\n<h2>21.3 – Put Call Parity</h2>\n<p>While we are discussing the topic on Option pricing, it perhaps makes sense to discuss  ‘Put Call Parity’ (PCP). PCP is a simple mathematical equation which states –</p>\n<p><strong>Put Value + Spot Price = Present value of strike (invested to maturity) + Call Value</strong>.</p>\n<p>The equation above holds true assuming –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Both the Put and Call are ATM options</li>\n<li>The options are European</li>\n<li>They both expire at the same time</li>\n<li>The options are held till expiry</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For people who are not familiar with the concept of Present value, I would suggest you read through this – <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/dcf-primer/\">http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/dcf-primer/</a> (section 14.3).</p>\n<p>Assuming you are familiar with the concept of Present value, we can restate the above equation as –</p>\n<p>P + S = Ke<sup>(-rt)</sup> + C</p>\n<p>Where, Ke<sup>(-rt)</sup> represents the present value of strike, with K being the strike itself. In mathematical terms, strike K is getting discounted continuously at rate of ‘r’ over time‘t’</p>\n<p>Also, do realize if you hold the present value of the strike and hold the same to maturity, you will get the value of strike itself, hence the above can be further restated as –</p>\n<p><strong>Put Option + Spot Price = Strike + Call options</strong></p>\n<p>So why should the equality hold? To help you understand this better think about two traders, Trader A and Trader B.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trader A holds ATM Put option and 1 share of the underlying stock (left hand side of PCP equation)</li>\n<li>Trader B holds a Call option and cash amount equivalent to the strike (right hand side of PCP equation)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This being the case, as per the PCP the amount of money both traders make (assuming they hold till expiry) should be the same. Let us put some numbers to evaluate the equation –</p>\n<p>Underlying = Infosys<br/>\nStrike = 1200<br/>\nSpot = 1200</p>\n<p>Trader A holds = 1200 PE + 1 share of Infy at 1200<br/>\nTrader B holds = 1200 CE + Cash equivalent to strike i.e 1200</p>\n<p>Assume upon expiry Infosys expires at 1100, what do you think happens?</p>\n<p>Trader A’s Put option becomes profitable and he makes Rs.100 however he loses 100 on the stock that he holds, hence his net pay off is 100 + 1100 = 1200.</p>\n<p>Trader B’s Call option becomes worthless, hence the option’s value goes to 0, however he has cash equivalent to 1200, hence his account value is 0 + 1200 = 1200.</p>\n<p>Let’s take another example, assume Infy hits 1350 upon expiry, lets see what happens to the accounts of both the trader’s.</p>\n<p>Trader A = Put goes to zero, stock goes to 1350/-<br/>\nTrader B = Call value goes to 150 + 1200 in cash = 1350/-</p>\n<p>So clearly, irrespective of where the stock expires, the equations hold true, meaning both trader A and trader B end up making the same amount of money.</p>\n<p>All good, but how would you use the PCP to develop a trading strategy? Well, for that you will have to wait for the next module which is dedicated to “Option Strategies” J. Before we start the next module on Option Strategies, we have 2 more chapters to go in this module.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The options calculator is based on the Black &amp; Scholes model</li>\n<li>The Black &amp; Scholes model is used to estimate the option’s theoretical price along with the option’s Greek</li>\n<li>The interest rate in the B&amp;S calculator refers to the risk free rate as available on the RBI site</li>\n<li>The implied volatility can be fetched from the option chain from the NSE website</li>\n<li>The put call parity states that the payoff from a put option plus the spot equals the payoff from call option plus the strike.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

After rigorously going through the options concept over the last 21 chapters, why are we now going back to “Call &amp; Put Options” again? In fact we started the module by discussing the Call &amp; Put options, so why all over again?</p>\n<p>Well, this is because I personally believe that there are two learning levels in options – before discovering option Greeks and after discovering the option Greeks. Now that we have spent time learning Option Greeks, perhaps it is time to take a fresh look at the basics of the call and put options, keeping the option Greeks in perspective.</p>\n<p>Let’s have a quick high-level recap –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You buy a Call option when you expect the underlying price to increase (you are out rightly bullish)</li>\n<li>You sell a Call option when you expect the underlying price not to increase (you expect the market to either stay flat or go down but certainly not up)</li>\n<li>You buy a Put option when you expect the underlying price to decrease (you are out rightly bearish)</li>\n<li>You sell a Put option when you expect the underlying price not to decrease (you expect the market to stay flat or go up but certainly not down)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course the initial few chapters gave us an understanding on the call and put option basics, but the agenda now is to understand the basics of call and put options keeping both volatility and time in perspective. So let’s get started.</p>\n<h2>22.2 – Effect of Volatility</h2>\n<p>We know that one needs to buy a Call Option when he/she expects the underlying asset to move higher. Fair enough, for a moment let us assume that Nifty is expected to go up by a certain percent, given this would you buy a Call option if –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The volatility is expected to go down while Nifty is expected to go up?</li>\n<li>What would you do if the time to expiry is just 2 days away?</li>\n<li>What would you do if the time to expiry is more than 15 days away?</li>\n<li>Which strike would you choose to trade in the above two cases – OTM, ATM, or ITM and why would you choose the same?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These questions clearly demonstrate the fact that buying a call option (or put option) is not really a straightforward task. There is a certain degree of ground work required before you buy an option. The ground work mainly revolves around assessment of volatility, time to expiry, and of course the directional movement of the market itself.</p>\n<p>I will not talk about the assessment of market direction here; this is something you will have to figure out yourself based on theories such as technical analysis, quantitative analysis, or any other technique that you deem suitable.</p>\n<p>For instance you could use technical analysis to identify that Nifty is likely to move up by 2-3% over the next few days. Having established this, what would you do? Would you buy an ATM option or ITM option? Given the fact that Nifty will move up by 2-3% over the next 2 days, which strike gives you maximum bang for the buck? This is the angle I would like to discuss in this chapter.</p>\n<p>Let’s start by looking at the following graph, if you recollect we discussed this in the chapter on Vega –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-1_CE.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_CE\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2703\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"370\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-1_CE.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-1_CE.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-1_CE-300x139.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The graph above depicts how a call option premium behaves with respect to increase in volatility across different ‘time to expiry’ time frames. For example the blue line shows how the call option premium behaves when there are 30 days to expiry, green for 15 days to expiry, and red for 5 days to expiry.</p>\n<p>With help of the graph above, we can arrive at a few practical conclusions which we can incorporate while buying/selling call options</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Regardless of time to expiry, the premium always increases with increase in volatility and the premium decreases with decrease in volatility</li>\n<li>For volatility to work in favor of a long call option one should time buying a call option when volatility is expected to increase and avoid buying call option when volatility is expected to decrease</li>\n<li>For volatility to work in favor of a short call option, one should time selling a call option when volatility is expected to fall and avoid selling a call option when the volatility is expected to increase</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is the graph of the put option premium versus volatility –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-2_PE.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_PE\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2704\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"370\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-2_PE.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-2_PE.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-2_PE-300x139.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>This graph is very similar to the graph of call premium versus volatility – therefore the same set of conclusions hold true for put options as well.</p>\n<p>These conclusions make one thing clear – buy options when you expect volatility to increase and short options when you expect the volatility to decrease. Now the next obvious question is – which strike to choose when you decide to buy or sell options? This is where the assessment of time to expiry comes into play.</p>\n<h2>22.3 – Effect of Time</h2>\n<p>Let us just assume that the volatility is expected to increase along with increase in the underlying prices. Clearly buying a call option makes sense. However the more important aspect is to identify the right strike to buy. Infact when you wish to buy an option it is important to analyze how far away we are with respect to market expiry. Selection of strike depends on the time to expiry.</p>\n<p>Do note – understanding the chart below may seem a bit confusing in the beginning, but it is not. So don’t get disheartened if you don’t get it the first time you read, just give it another shot </p>\n<p>Before we proceed we need to get a grip on the timelines first. A typical F&amp;O series has about 30 days before expiry (barring February series). To help you understand better, I have divided the series into 2 halves – the first half refers to the first 15 days of the series and the 2<sup>nd</sup> half refers to the last 15 days of the F&amp;O series. Please do keep this in perspective while reading through below.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the image below; it contains 4 bar charts representing the profitability of different strikes. The chart assumes –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The stock is at 5000 in the spot market, hence strike 5000 is ATM</li>\n<li>The trade is executed at some point in the 1<sup>st</sup> half of the series i.e between the start of the F&amp;O series and 15<sup>th</sup> of the month</li>\n<li>We expect the stock to move 4% i.e from 5000 to 5200</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given the above, the chart tries to investigate which strike would be the most profitable given the target of 4% is achieved within –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>5 days of trade initiation</li>\n<li>15 days of trade initiation</li>\n<li>25 days of trade initiation</li>\n<li>On expiry day</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-3_CE_Theta.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_CE_Theta\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2705\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"358\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-3_CE_Theta.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-3_CE_Theta.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-3_CE_Theta-300x134.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>So let us start from the <strong>first chart</strong> on the left top. This chart shows the profitability of different call option strikes given that the trade is executed in the first half of the F&amp;O series. The target is expected to be achieved within 5 days of trade execution.</p>\n<p>Here is a classic example – today is 7<sup>th</sup> Oct, Infosys results are on 12<sup>th</sup> Oct, and you are bullish on the results. You want to buy a call option with an intention of squaring it off 5 days from now, which strike would you choose?</p>\n<p>From the chart it is clear – when there is ample time to expiry (remember we are at some point in the 1<sup>st</sup> half of the series), and the stock moves in the expected direction, then all strikes tend to make money. However, the strikes that make maximum money are (far) OTM options. As we can notice from the chart, maximum money is made by 5400 and 5500 strike.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> – When we are in the 1<sup>st</sup> half of the expiry series, and you expect the target to be achieved quickly (say over few days) buy OTM options. In fact I would suggest you buy 2 or 3 strikes away from ATM and not beyond that.</p>\n<p>Look at the <strong>2<sup>nd</sup> chart (top right)</strong> – here the assumption is that the trade is executed in the 1<sup>st</sup> half the series, the stock is expected to move by 4%, but the target is expected to be achieved in 15 days. Except for the time frame (target to be achieved) everything else remains the same. Notice how the profitability changes, clearly buying far OTM option does not makes sense. In fact you may even lose money when you buy these OTM options (look at the profitability of 5500 strike).</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> – When we in the 1<sup>st</sup> half of the expiry series, and you expect the target to be achieved over 15 days, it makes sense to buy ATM or slightly OTM options. I would not recommend buying options that are more than 1 strike away from ATM. One should certainly avoid buying far OTM options.</p>\n<p>In the <strong>3<sup>rd</sup> chart (bottom left)</strong> the trade is executed in the 1<sup>st</sup> half the series and target expectation (4% move) remains the same but the target time frame is different. Here the target is expected to be achieved 25 days from the time of trade execution. Clearly as we can see OTM options are not worth buying. In most of the cases one ends up losing money with OTM options. Instead what makes sense is buying ITM options.</p>\n<p>Also, at this stage I have to mention this – people end up buying OTM options simply because the premiums are lower. Do not fall for this, the low premium of OTM options creates an illusion that you won’t lose much, but in reality there is a very high probability for you to lose all the money, albeit small amounts. This is especially true in cases where the market moves but not at the right speed. For example the market may move 4% but if this move is spread across 15 days, then it does not make sense holding far OTM options. However, far OTM options make money when the movement in the market is swift – for example a 4% move within 1 or say 2 days. This is when far OTM options moves smartly.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> – When we are at the start of the expiry series, and you expect the target to be achieved over 25 days, it makes sense to buy ITM options. One should certainly avoid buying ATM or OTM options.</p>\n<p>The <strong>last chart (bottom right)</strong> is quite similar to the 3<sup>rd</sup> chart, except that you expect the target to be achieved on the day of the expiry (over very close to expiry). The <strong>conclusion</strong> is simple – under such a scenario all option strikes, except ITM lose money. Traders should avoid buying ATM or OTM options.</p>\n<p>Let us look at another set of charts – the idea here is to figure out which strikes to choose given that the trade is executed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series i.e at any point from 15<sup>th </sup> of the month till the expiry. Do bear in mind the effect of time decay accelerates in this period; hence as we are moving closer to expiry the dynamic of options change.</p>\n<p>The 4 charts below help us identify the right strike for different time frames during which the target is achieved. Of course we do this while keeping theta in perspective.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-4_CE_Theta.png\"><img alt=\"Image 4_CE_Theta\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2706\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"369\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-4_CE_Theta.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-4_CE_Theta.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-4_CE_Theta-300x138.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>Chart 1 (top left)</strong> evaluates the profitability of different strikes wherein the trade is executed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series and the target is achieved the same day of trade initiation. News driven option trade such as buying an option owing to a corporate announcement is a classic example. Buying an index option based on the monetary policy decision by RBI is another example.  Clearly as we can see from the chart all strikes tend to make money when the target is achieved the same day, however the maximum impact would be on (far) OTM options.</p>\n<p>Do recall the discussion we had earlier – when market moves swiftly (like 4% in 1 day), the best strikes to trade are always far OTM.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> – When you expect the target to be achieved the same day (irrespective of time to expiry) buy far OTM options. I would suggest you buy 2 or 3 strikes away from ATM options and not beyond that. There is no point buying ITM or ATM options.</p>\n<p><strong>Chart 2 (top right)</strong> evaluates the profitability of different strikes wherein the trade is executed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series and the target is achieved within 5 days of trade initiation. Notice how the profitability of far OTM options diminishes. In the above case (chart 1) the target is expected to be achieved in 1 day therefore buying (far) OTM options made sense, but here the target is achieved in 5 days, and because the trade is kept open for 5 days especially during the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series, the impact of theta is higher. Hence it just does not make sense risking with far OTM options. The safest bet under such a scenario is strikes which are slightly OTM.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion </strong>– When you are in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series, and you expect the target to be achieved around 5 days from the time of trade execution buy strikes that are slightly OTM. I would suggest you buy 1 strike away from ATM options and not beyond that.</p>\n<p><strong>Chart 3 (bottom right) and Chart 4 (bottom left) </strong>– both these charts are similar except in chart 3 the target is achieved 10 days from the trade initiation and in chart 4, the target is expected to be achieved on the day of the expiry. I suppose the difference in terms of number of days won’t be much, hence I would treat them to be quite similar. From both these charts we can reach 1 <strong>conclusion</strong> – far OTM options tend to lose money when the target is expected to be achieved close to expiry. In fact when the target is achieved closer to the expiry, the heavier the far OTM options bleed. The only strikes that make money are ATM or slightly ITM option.</p>\n<p>While the discussions we have had so far are with respect to buying a call option, similar observations can be made for PUT options as well. Here are two charts that help us understand which strikes to buy under various situations –</p>\n<p>These charts help us understand which strikes to trade when the trade is initiated in the first half of the series, and the target is achieved under different time frames.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-5_PE_Theta.png\"><img alt=\"Image 5_PE_Theta\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2707\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"369\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-5_PE_Theta.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-5_PE_Theta.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-5_PE_Theta-300x138.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>While these charts help us understand which strikes to trade when is the trade is executed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series and the target is achieved under different time frames.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-6_PE_Theta.png\"><img alt=\"Image 6_PE_Theta\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2708\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"369\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-6_PE_Theta.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-6_PE_Theta.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-6_PE_Theta-300x138.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>If you go through the charts carefully you will realize that the conclusions for the Call options holds true for the Put options as well. Given this we can generalize the best practices for buying options –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th><strong>Position Initiation</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Target Expectation</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Best strike to trade</strong></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st half of the series</td>\n<td>5 days from initiation</td>\n<td>Far OTM (2 strikes away from ATM)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st half of the series</td>\n<td>15 days from initiation</td>\n<td>ATM or slightly OTM (1 strike away from ATM)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st half of the series</td>\n<td>25 days from initiation</td>\n<td>Slightly ITM options</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st half of the series</td>\n<td>On expiry day</td>\n<td>ITM</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd half of the series</td>\n<td>Same day</td>\n<td>Far OTM (2 or 3 strikes away from ATM)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd half of the series</td>\n<td>5 days from initiation</td>\n<td>Slightly OTM (1 strike away from ATM)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd half of the series</td>\n<td>10 days from initiation</td>\n<td>Slightly ITM or ATM</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd half of the series</td>\n<td>On expiry day</td>\n<td>ITM</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So the next time you intend to buy a naked Call or Put option, make sure you map the period (either 1<sup>st</sup> half or 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series) and the time frame during which the target is expected to be achieved. Once you do this, with the help of the table above you will know which strikes to trade and more importantly you will know which strikes to avoid buying.</p>\n<p>With this, we are now at the verge of completion of this module. In the next chapter I would like to discuss some of the simple trades that I initiated over the last few days and also share my trade rationale behind each trade. Hopefully the case studies that I will present in the next chapter will give you a perspective on the general thought process behind simple option trades.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Volatility plays a crucial role in your decision to buy options</li>\n<li>In general buy options when you expect the volatility to go higher</li>\n<li>Sell options when you expect the volatility to decrease</li>\n<li>Besides volatility the time to expiry and the time frame during which the target is expected to be achieved also matters</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

I’ve mentioned this earlier in the module, at this point I feel compelled to reiterate the same – options, unlike futures is not a straight forward instrument to understand. Options are multi dimensional instruments primarily because it has many market forces acting on it <strong>simultaneously</strong>, and this makes options a very difficult instrument to deal with. From my experience I’ve realized the only way to understand options is by regularly trading them, based on options theory logic.</p>\n<p>To help you get started I would like to discuss few <strong>simple</strong> option trades executed successfully. Now here is the best part, these trades are executed by Zerodha Varsity readers over the last 2 months. I believe these are trades inspired by reading through the contents of Zerodha Varsity, or at least this is what I was told. 🙂</p>\n<p>Either ways I’m happy because each of these trades has a logic backed by a multi disciplinary approach. So in that sense it is very gratifying, and it certainly makes a perfect end to this module on Options Theory.</p>\n<p>Do note the traders were kind enough to oblige to my request to discuss their trades here, however upon their request I will refrain from identifying them.</p>\n<p>Here are the 4 trades that I will discuss –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>CEAT India – Directional trade, inspired by Technical Analysis logic</li>\n<li>Nifty – Delta neutral, leveraging the effect of Vega</li>\n<li>Infosys – Delta neutral, leveraging the effect of Vega</li>\n<li>Infosys – Directional trade, common sense fundamental approach</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For each trade I will discuss what I like about it and what could have been better. Do note, all the snapshots presented here are taken by the traders themselves, I just specified the format in which I need these snapshots.</p>\n<p>So, let’s get started.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch23-Cartoon1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2747\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-Ch23-Cartoon1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-Ch23-Cartoon1.png 350w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-Ch23-Cartoon1-300x171.png 300w\" width=\"350\"/></p>\n<h2>23.2 – CEAT India</h2>\n<p>The trade was executed by a 27 year old ‘Options newbie’. Apparently this was his first options trade ever.</p>\n<p><strong>Here is his logic for the trade:</strong> CEAT Ltd was trading around Rs.1260/- per share. Clearly the stock has been in a good up trend. However he believed the rally would not continue as there was some sort of exhaustion in the rally.</p>\n<p>My thinking is that he was encouraged to believe so by looking at the last few candles, clearly the last three day’s trading range was diminishing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-1.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2735\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"298\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-1.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-1-300x112.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>To put thoughts into action, he bought the 1220 (OTM) Put options by paying a premium of Rs.45.75/- per lot. The trade was executed on 28<sup>th</sup> September and expiry for the contract was on October 29th. Here is the snapshot of the same –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-2.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2736\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"487\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-2.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-2.png 574w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-2-300x255.png 300w\" width=\"574\"/></a></p>\n<p>I asked the trader few questions to understand this better –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why did you choose to trade options and not short futures?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Shorting futures would be risky, especially in this case as reversals could be sharp and MTM in case of sharp reversals would be painful</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>When there is so much time to expiry, why did I choose to trade a slightly OTM option and not really far OTM option?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>This is because of liquidity. Stock options are not really liquid, hence sticking to strikes around ATM is a good idea</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>What about stoploss?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The plan is to square off the trade if CEAT makes a new high. In other words a new high on CEAT indicates that the uptrend is still intact, and therefore my contrarian short call was flawed</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>What about target?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Since the stock is in a good up trend, the idea is to book profits as soon as it’s deemed suitable. Reversals can be sharp, so no point holding on to short trades. In fact it would not be a bad idea to reverse the trade and buy a call option.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>What about holding period?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The trade is a play on appreciation in premium value. So I will certainly not look at holding this to expiry. Given that there is ample time to expiry, a small dip in stock price will lead to a decent appreciation in premium.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note – the QnA is reproduced in my own words, the idea here is to produce the gist and not the exact word to word conversation.</p>\n<p>So after he bought CEAT PE, this is what happened the very next day –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-3.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2737\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"485\" sizes=\"(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-3.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-3.png 572w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-3-300x254.png 300w\" width=\"572\"/></a></p>\n<p>Stock price declined to 1244, and the premium appreciated to 52/-. He was right when he said “since there is ample time to expiry, a small dip in the stock price will lead to a good increase in option premium”. He was happy with 7/- in profits (per lot) and hence he decided to close the trade.</p>\n<p>Looking back I guess this was probably a good move.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-4.png\"><img alt=\"Image 4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2738\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"417\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-4.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-4.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-4-300x156.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Anyway, I guess this is not bad for a first time, overnight options trade.</p>\n<p><strong>My thoughts on this trade </strong>– Firstly I need to appreciate this trader’s clarity of thought, more so considering this was his first options trade. If I were to set up a trade on this, I would have done this slightly differently.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the chart perspective the thought process was clear – exhaustion in the rally. Given this belief I would prefer selling call options instead of buying them. Why would I do this? – Well, exhaustion does not necessarily translate to correction in stock prices. More often than not, the stock would enter a side way movement making it attractive to option sellers</li>\n<li>I would select strikes based on the normal distribution calculation as explained earlier in this module (needless to say, one had to keep liquidity in perspective as well)</li>\n<li>I would have executed the trade (selling calls) in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series to benefit from time decay</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Personally I do not prefer naked directional trades as they do not give me a visibility on risk and reward. However the only time when I initiate a naked long call option (based on technical analysis) trade is when I observe a flag formation –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stock should have rallied (prior trend) at least 5-10%</li>\n<li>Should have started correcting (3% or so) on low volumes – indicates profit booking by week hands</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I find this a good setup to buy call options.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch23-Cartoon2\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2748 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"177\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-Ch23-Cartoon2.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-Ch23-Cartoon2.png 350w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-Ch23-Cartoon2-300x152.png 300w\" width=\"350\"/></p>\n<h2>23.3 – RBI News play (Nifty Options)</h2>\n<p>This is a trade in Nifty Index options based on RBI’s monetary policy announcement. The trade was executed by a Varsity reader from Delhi. I considered this trade structured and well designed.</p>\n<p>Here is the background for this trade.</p>\n<p>Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was expected to announce their monetary policy on 29<sup>th</sup> September. While it is hard for anyone to guess what kind of decision RBI would take, the general expectation in the market was that RBI would slash the repo rates by 25 basis points. For people not familiar with monetary policy and repo rates, I would suggest you read this –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/key-events-and-their-impact-on-markets/\">http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/key-events-and-their-impact-on-markets/</a></p>\n<p>RBI’s monetary policy is one of the most eagerly awaited events by the market participants as it tends to have a major impact on market’s direction.</p>\n<p>Here are few empirical market observations this trader has noted in the backdrop market events –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The market does not really move in any particular direction, especially 2 – 3 days prior to the announcement. He find this applicable to stocks as well – ex : quarterly results</li>\n<li>Before the event/announcement market’s volatility invariably shoots up</li>\n<li>Because the volatility shoots up, the option premiums (for both CE and PE) also shoot up</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While, I cannot vouch for his first observations, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> observation does make sense.</p>\n<p>So in the backdrop of RBI’s policy announcement, ample time value, and increased volatility (see image below) he decided to write options on 28<sup>th</sup> of September.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-5.png\"><img alt=\"Image 5\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2739\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"309\" sizes=\"(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-5.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-5.png 394w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-5-300x235.png 300w\" width=\"394\"/></a></p>\n<p>Nifty was somewhere around 7780, hence the strike 7800 was the ATM option. The 7800 CE was trading at 203 and the 7800 PE was trading at 176, both of which he wrote and collected a combined premium of Rs.379/-.</p>\n<p>Here is the option chain showing the option prices.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-6.png\"><img alt=\"Image 6\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2740\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"414\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-6.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-6.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-6-300x155.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>I had a discussion with him to understand his plan of action; I’m reproducing the same (in my own words) for your understanding –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why are you shorting 7800 CE and 7800 PE?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Since there was ample time to expiry and increased volatility, I believe that the options are expensive, and premiums are higher than usual. I expect the volatility to decrease eventually and therefore the premiums to decrease as well. This would give me an opportunity to buyback both the options at a lower price</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Why did you choose to short ATM option?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>There is a high probability that I would place market orders at the time of exit, given this I want to ensure that the loss due to impact cost is minimized. ATM options have lesser impact cost, therefore it was a natural choice.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>For how long do you plan to hold the trade?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Volatility usually drops as we approach the announcement time. From empirical observation I believe that the best time to square of these kinds of trade would be minutes before the announcement. RBI is expected to make the announcement around 11:00 AM on September29<sup>th</sup>; hence I plan to square off the trade by 10:50 AM.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>What kind of profits do you expect for this trade?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>I expect around 10 – 15 points profits per lot for this trade.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>What is you stop loss for this trade?\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Since the trade is a play on volatility, its best to place SL based on Volatility and not really on the option premiums. Besides this trade comes with a predefined ‘time based stoploss’ – remember no matter what happens, the idea is to get out minutes before RBI makes the announcement.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So with these thoughts, he initiated the trade. To be honest, I was more confident about the success of this trade compared to the previous trade on CEAT. To a large extent I attribute the success of CEAT trade to luck, but this one seemed like a more rational set up.</p>\n<p>Anyway, as per plan the next day he did manage to close the trade minutes before RBI could make the policy announcement.</p>\n<p>Here is the screenshot of the options chain –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-7.png\"><img alt=\"Image 7\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2741\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"411\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-7.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-7.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-7-300x154.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>As expected the volatility dropped and both the options lost some value. The 7800 CE was trading at 191 and the 7800 PE was trading at 178. The combined premium value was at 369, and he did manage to make a quick 10 point profit per lot on this trade. Not too bad for an overnight trade I suppose.</p>\n<p>Just to give you a perspective – this is what happened immediately after the news hit the market.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-8.png\"><img alt=\"Image 8\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2742\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"383\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-8.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-8.png 383w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-8-150x150.png 150w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-8-300x300.png 300w\" width=\"383\"/></a></p>\n<p><strong>My thoughts on this trade – </strong>In general I do subscribe to the theory of volatility movement and shorting options before major market events. However such trades are to be executed couple of days before the event and not 1 day before.</p>\n<p>Let me take this opportunity to clear one misconception with respect to the news/announcement based option trades. Many traders I know usually set up the opposite trade i.e buy both Call and Put option before major events. This strategy is also called the “Long Straddle”. The thought process with a long straddle is straight forward – after the announcement the market is bound to move, based on the direction of the market movement either Call or Put options will make money. Given this the idea is simple – hold the option which is making money and square off the option that is making a loss. While this may seem like a perfectly logical and intuitive trade, what people usually miss out is the impact of volatility.</p>\n<p>When the news hits the market, the market would certainly move. For example if the news is good, the Call options will definitely move. <strong>However more often than not the speed at which the Put option premium will lose value is faster than the speed at which the call option premium would gain value</strong>. Hence you will end up losing more money on the Put option and make less money on Call option. For this reasons I believe selling options before an event to be more meaningful.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch23-Cartoon3\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2749 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-Ch23-Cartoon3.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-Ch23-Cartoon3.png 350w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-Ch23-Cartoon3-300x171.png 300w\" width=\"350\"/></p>\n<h2>23.4 – Infosys Q2 Results</h2>\n<p>This trade is very similar to the previous RBI trade but better executed. The trade was executed by another Delhiite.</p>\n<p>Infosys was expected to announce their Q2 results on 12<sup>th</sup> October. The idea was simple – news drives volatility up, so short options with an expectation that you can buy it back when the volatility cools off. The trade was well planned and the position was initiated on 8<sup>th</sup> Oct – 4 days prior to the event.</p>\n<p>Infosys was trading close to Rs.1142/- per share, so he decided to go ahead with the 1140 strike (ATM).</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot at the time of initiating the trade –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-9.png\"><img alt=\"Image 9\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2743\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"504\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-9.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-9.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-9-300x189.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>On 8<sup>th</sup> October around 10:35 AM the 1140 CE was trading at 48/- and the implied volatility was at 40.26%. The 1140 PE was trading at 47/- and the implied volatility was at 48%. The combined premium received was 95 per lot.</p>\n<p>I repeated the same set of question (asked during the earlier RBI trade) and the answers received were very similar. For this reason I will skip posting the question and answer extract here.</p>\n<p>Going back to Infosys’s Q2 results, the market’s expectation was that Infosys would announce fairly decent set of numbers. In fact the numbers were better than expected, here are the details –</p>\n<p>“For the July-September quarter, Infosys posted a net profit of $519 million, compared with $511 million in the year-ago period. Revenue jumped 8.7 % to $2.39 billion. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 6%, comfortably eclipsing market expectations of 4-4.5% growth.</p>\n<p>In rupee terms, net profit rose 9.8% to Rs.3398 crore on revenue of Rs. 15,635 crore, which was up 17.2% from last year”.<em> Source: Economic Times.</em></p>\n<p>The announcement came in around 9:18 AM, 3 minutes after the market opened, and this trader did manage to close the trade around the same time.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-10.png\"><img alt=\"Image 10\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2744\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"480\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-10.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-10.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-10-300x180.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The 1140 CE was trading at 55/- and the implied volatility had dropped to 28%. The 1140 PE was trading at 20/- and the implied volatility had dropped to 40%.</p>\n<p>Do pay attention to this – the speed at which the call option shot up was lesser than the speed at which the Put option dropped its value. The combined premium was 75 per lot, and he made a 20 point profit per lot.</p>\n<p><strong>My thoughts on this trade –</strong> I do believe this trader comes with some experience; it is quite evident with the trade’s structure. If I were to execute this trade I would probably do something very similar.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M5-Ch23-Cartoon4\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2750\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"200\" sizes=\"(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-Ch23-Cartoon4.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-Ch23-Cartoon4.png 350w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/M5-Ch23-Cartoon4-300x171.png 300w\" width=\"350\"/></p>\n<h2>23.5 – Infosys Q2 aftermath (fundamentals based)</h2>\n<p>This trade was executed by a fellow Bangalorean. I know him personally. He comes with impressive fundamental analysis skills. He has now started experimenting with options with the intention of identifying option trading opportunities backed by his fundamental analysis skills. It would certainly be interesting to track his story going forward.</p>\n<p>Here is the background to the trade –</p>\n<p>Infosys had just announced an extremely good set of numbers but the stock was down 5% or so on 12<sup>th</sup> Oct and about 1% on 13<sup>th</sup> Oct.</p>\n<p>Upon further research, he realize that the stock was down because Infosys cut down their revenue guidance. Slashing down the revenue guidance is a very realistic assessment of business, and he believed that the market had already factored this. However the stock going down by 6% was not really the kind of reaction you would expect even after markets factoring in the news.</p>\n<p>He believed that the market participants had clearly over reacted to guidance value, so much so that the market failed to see through the positive side of the results.</p>\n<p>His belief – if you simultaneously present the markets good news and bad news, market always reacts to bad news first. This was exactly what was going on in Infosys.</p>\n<p>He decided to go long on a call option with an expectation that the market will eventually wake up and react to the Q2 results.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-11.png\"><img alt=\"Image 11\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2745\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"497\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-11.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-11.png 576w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-11-300x259.png 300w\" width=\"576\"/></a></p>\n<p>He decided to buy Infosys’s 1100 CE at 18.9/- which was slightly OTM. He planned to hold the trade till the 1100 strike transforms to ITM. He was prepared to risk Rs.8.9/- on this trade, which meant that if the premium dropped to Rs.10, he would be getting out of the trade taking a loss.</p>\n<p>After executing the trade, the stock did bounce back and he got an opportunity to close the trade on 21<sup>st</sup> Oct.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-12.png\"><img alt=\"Image 12\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2746\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"497\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-12.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-12.png 571w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Image-12-300x261.png 300w\" width=\"571\"/></a></p>\n<p>He more than doubled his money on this trade. Must have been a sweet trade for him</p>\n<p>Do realize the entire logic for the trade was developed using simple understanding of financial statements, business fundamentals, and options theory.</p>\n<p><strong>My thoughts on this trade – </strong>Personally I would not be very uncomfortable initiating naked trades. Besides in this particular while the entry was backed by logic, the exit, and stoploss weren’t. Also, since there was ample time to expiry the trader could have risked with slightly more OTM options.</p>\n<p>And with this my friends, we are at the end of this module on Options Theory!</p>\n<p>I hope you found this material useful and I really hope this makes a positive impact on your options trading techniques.</p>\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

    "lesson": "24. Quick note on Physical Settlement",
    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2><b>24.1 – Overview</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until recent times, trading in equity futures and options was cash settled in India. What this means is that upon expiry of the contract, buyers or sellers had to settle their position in cash without having to take delivery of the underlying security. On April 11, 2018, SEBI released a circular making physical delivery of stocks for all stock F&amp;O contracts mandatory in a phased manner. The aim was to curb excessive speculation which would result in too much volatility in individual stocks.</span></p>\n<h2><b>24.2 What is Physical Settlement? </b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It means all stock F&amp;O contracts at expiry, are required to be given/taken delivery of the underlying security. From October 2019’s expiry, all stock F&amp;O contracts are compulsorily settled physically. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s understand this with an example, before the introduction of physical settlement, if you bought only a lot of SBI futures expiring this month, on expiry, the contract will be cash-settled based on the settlement price and you will receive the credit or debit in your trading account. We’ve explained how marked to market settlement works in this </span><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/margin-m2m/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">chapter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But with the physical settlement, if you don’t close or rollover your position till expiry, you are required to pay the total contract value and you will receive the delivery of shares to your Demat account.</span></p>\n<h2><b>24.3 Why is Physical Settlement enforced?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the contract is cash-settled, traders only are required to maintain the margin(SPAN +Exposure) for the contract and can lead to short-sellers building up excessive short positions closer to expiry artificially bringing down the price. With the physical settlement, these traders will have to buy the stock from the equity market or borrow on the SLB markets to be able to deliver the stocks to the counterparty. This brings in balance to the price not allowing for price manipulation.</span></p>\n<h2><b>24.4 How are positions settled?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On expiry, various F&amp;O contracts are settled in the following manner</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take Delivery(stocks are delivered to your Demat account)- Long Futures, long ITM Call and short ITM Put</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give Delivery(you are required to deliver the stocks to the exchange)- Short Futures, short ITM Call and long ITM Put. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only ITM options will be physically settled, if the option expires OTM, they expire worthlessly and there won’t be any delivery obligation. </span></p>\n<h2><b>24.5 Netted off positions(subcategory)</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have multiple positions of the same underlying for the same expiration date and they form a hedge, depending on the direction of the trade, they will be netted off.</span></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>1st Leg</b></td>\n<td><b>2nd Leg</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Long Futures</b></td>\n<td><b>Short ITM Call</b>\n<p><b>Long ITM Put</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Short Futures</b></td>\n<td><b>Long ITM Call</b>\n<p><b>Short ITM Put</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Long ITM Call</b></td>\n<td><b>Long ITM Put</b>\n<p><b>Short ITM Call</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Long ITM Put</b></td>\n<td><b>Long ITM Call</b>\n<p><b>Short ITM Put</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Short ITM Call</b></td>\n<td><b>Long ITM Call</b>\n<p><b>Short ITM Put</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Short ITM Put</b></td>\n<td><b>Short ITM Call</b>\n<p><b>Long ITM Put</b></p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you have an SBI June long futures contract and long ITM Put of strike 200(SBI spot price at Rs 180), the long futures position will lead to a take delivery obligation and the long put option to a given delivery obligation. This will be netted off for your account and there won’t be any physical delivery obligation.</span></p>\n<h2><b>24.6 Margins</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are trading in the F&amp;O segment, for futures and short options, you will require to maintain only the margin amount in your account, for long options, just the premium required to buy. However, this changes with the physical settlement mechanism, where you are required to bring in 100% of the contract value to take delivery of the contract or bring in stocks to give delivery(depending on the direction of your trade). Brokers introduce additional margins when such positions get closer to expiry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can read on Zerodha’s physical settlement policy </span><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/z-connect/queries/policy-on-settlement-of-compulsory-delivery-derivative-contracts-update-oct-2019\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

To understand, you need to think about the core premise of a futures contract. Rather,  the core premise of a forwards contract. Remember, futures are essentially an improvisation over a forwards contract.</p>\n<p>The underlying premise in the futures contract is that buyers and sellers agree to get into a contract TODAY at a pre-decided price and quantity. The actual exchange of goods (stocks) happens at a date set in the future.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose I press that buy button and buy Reliance Futures today, then it implies I get the delivery of Reliance shares from the Reliance futures seller on contract expiry in December. Of course, assuming I hold the contract till expiry.</p>\n<p>Now, for a moment, assume on the contract expiry day, instead of taking delivery of Reliance, I walk away from my obligation. What happens next?</p>\n<p>Walking away from the obligation implies that the person who sold the futures to me, i.e. my counterparty, is left with an open-ended contract. The purpose of a futures contract is lost, and the exchanges cannot afford to let this happen.</p>\n<p>The exchange overcomes the default or the counterparty risk by charging a margin and running a P&amp;L mark to market (M2M).</p>\n<h2><strong>25.2 – Margin and M2M </strong></h2>\n<p>The structure of a futures contract is such that there is no counterparty/default risk. Of course, there is a price risk, but that’s another thing altogether. Exchanges prevent default in two ways – they block a margin when buyers and sellers enter a futures trade, and the exchange also runs a daily mark to market process.</p>\n<p>Margins ensure there is skin in the game, and the mark to market process ensures that daily profits and losses are credited and debited to the relevant parties.</p>\n<p>I’ve explained the technicalities of <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/margin-m2m/\"><strong>margins</strong> and <strong>mark to market</strong></a> in the futures module. At this stage, please keep this thought of margins and mark to market and shift gears back to options.</p>\n<h2><strong>25.3 – Options buyer</strong></h2>\n<p>Place yourself in the shoes of the buyer of an option. To buy options, you pay a premium. Premium times the lot size times the number of lots is the total cash required to purchase an option.</p>\n<p>For example, if I want to buy one lot of Reliance 2500 Call option –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-3_reliance-opt.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10299\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"427\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-3_reliance-opt-300x216.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-3_reliance-opt-300x216.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-3_reliance-opt.png 673w\" width=\"593\"/></a></p>\n<p>The call option is trading at 76, lot size is 250, therefore –</p>\n<p>1 *250*76</p>\n<p>=Rs.19,000/-</p>\n<p>As long as I have 19K in my account, I can buy the RIL 2500 CE. In a sense, this is a cash and carry deal, which makes two things very clear –</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>The amount required to buy an option and get into an options agreement – 19K in this case</li>\n<li>The maximum risk for the buyer – again 19K</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike buying futures, the risk is not open-ended when you buy an option regardless of call or put. The risk is predetermined, and since it’s a cash and carry deal, there is no question of default.</p>\n<p>Given that the risk of default is zero for an option buyer, do you think it makes sense to block margins for an option buyer? It does not make sense in doing so for obvious reasons.</p>\n<p>But is there a need to mark to market the daily profits and losses to the option buyer? We will answer that in a bit.</p>\n<p>Shift gears and think about the option seller.</p>\n<p>For an option seller, we know the risk is significantly higher compared to an option buyer, and it is similar to a futures trader’s risk.</p>\n<p>The risk of option selling is open-ended, and that introduces the risk of default as well.</p>\n<p>Since the risk profile of an option seller is similar to the futures seller, the exchange levies a margin (SPAN + Exposure) to option sellers to counter the default risk.</p>\n<p>For example, if I were to sell the RIL 2500 CE, the margin I need to bring to the table is Rs.1,36,530/-.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-4_optsell.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10300\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"421\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-4_optsell-300x213.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-4_optsell-300x213.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-4_optsell.png 667w\" width=\"593\"/></a></p>\n<p>However, unlike in the futures contract, there is no mark to market in options. Think about it – in a futures trade, both the buyer and the seller have to put in a margin to enter the trade. But in options, only the seller puts in a margin. The buyer pays the premium in full.</p>\n<p>If there was a mark to market in options, it implies that the notional profits or losses should be credited or debited to the option buyer. However, the option buyer has not placed any margins on the exchange.</p>\n<p>Hence there is no concept of mark to market (M2M) in options.</p>\n<p>The fact that there is no mark to market triggers another common question – how are profits and loss settled in options?</p>\n<h2><strong>25.4 – Options P&amp;L for the buyer </strong></h2>\n<p>Option P&amp;L is pretty straightforward, and the lack of mark to market makes it easier to understand compared to understanding the future’s P&amp;L.</p>\n<p>The complication in understanding the options P&amp;L stems from the multiple market scenarios for the position you have. Here is what I mean by that –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-5_call.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10301\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"330\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-5_call-300x167.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-5_call-300x167.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-5_call-768x428.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-5_call.png 881w\" width=\"593\"/></a></p>\n<p>A trader can go long on a call option or short on the call, post which the trader can decide to hold the position up until the expiry or close the position before expiry. The P&amp;L in each case varies.</p>\n<p>The same goes with the put option –</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-6_put.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10302\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"321\" sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-6_put-300x163.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-6_put-300x163.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-6_put-768x417.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-6_put.png 900w\" width=\"590\"/></a></p>\n<p>As an options trader, you need to get comfortable with P&amp;L calculation in each of these cases.</p>\n<p>But the good thing is that we can generalize the P&amp;L for both long and short trades for instances where the trader closes the position before expiry.</p>\n<p>For trades held to expiry, physical settlement kicks in, making it slightly tricky to understand.</p>\n<h4><em><strong>Call and Put option Long, close before the expiry</strong></em></h4>\n<p>If the trader decides to close the position before expiry, we can generalize the P&amp;L for a long option trader (both call and put).</p>\n<p>P&amp;L = [Difference between buying and selling price of premium] * Lot size * Number of lots.</p>\n<p>For example, if I buy two lots of Reliance 2500 CE at 76 and decide to sell the same after a few hours at 79, then my P&amp;L is –</p>\n<p>= [ 79 – 76] * 250 * 2</p>\n<p>= 3 * 250 * 2</p>\n<p>= 1500</p>\n<p>Of course, 1500 minus all the applicable charges.</p>\n<p>The P&amp;L calculation is the same for long put options, squared off before expiry.</p>\n<h4><em><strong>Call and Put option short, close before the expiry</strong></em></h4>\n<p>As you know, when a trader shorts an option (regardless of call or put), margins are blocked to the extent of SPAN + Exposure.</p>\n<p>Margin charged is a function of premium price and the volatility of the underlying. Generally, margin increases if –</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>The price of the option (premium) moves against your position</li>\n<li>Volatility increase</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both don’t need to happen; margins can increase even if one of them occurs.</p>\n<p>For example, assume you wrote/sold the Reliance 2500 put option at 80; the lot size is 250. If you write the put option, volatility stays the same, but the premium increases to 130, i.e. an increase of 50 Rupees, then the margin also increases by approximately Rs.12,500 (50*250).</p>\n<p>Or let us say after you write the option, volatility shoots up, and the price remains the same; then again, the margins increase. Having said that, as you know, when volatility rises, option premium increases; we have discussed that extensively in the <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/understanding-volatility-part-1/\"><strong>volatility chapter</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Have a look at this again –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-4_optsell.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10300\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"421\" sizes=\"(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-4_optsell-300x213.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-4_optsell-300x213.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-4_optsell.png 667w\" width=\"593\"/></a></p>\n<p>To short or write Reliance 2500 CE at 76 per lot, I need a margin of Rs.1,36,530. Now, after I write this option, imagine the price increases to 126, the margin for this option increases approximately  –</p>\n<p>50 * 250</p>\n<p>= 12,500.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the new margin required is –</p>\n<p>= 136530 +12500</p>\n<p>= 149030</p>\n<p>At, this point the broker will notify to bring in the additional margins (margin call) because the percentage margin utilization is –</p>\n<p>Current margin / Margin at the time of writing the option</p>\n<p>= 149030 / 136530</p>\n<p>=109%</p>\n<p>If you fail to bring in the additional margins, the broker can square off the short position because of the penalties imposed by the <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/z-connect/zerodha/bulletin-latest-at-zerodha/peak-margin-intraday-leverages-2nd-order-effects-dec-1st-2020\"><strong>peak margin policy</strong></a>. Usually, the tolerance is about 120% margin utilization, beyond which the broker squares off the position immediately.</p>\n<p>Anyway, continuing with our example, when the premium hits 126, and you no longer wish to hold the position (by adding additional margins to your account) and decide to square off.</p>\n<p>The P&amp;L is –</p>\n<p>[Difference between the buy price and sell price of premium] * lot size * number of lots</p>\n<p>= 50 * 250 * 1</p>\n<p>=12,500</p>\n<p>When you square off the position, margins are unblocked after adjusting for the profit or loss; settlement of P&amp;L happens on a T+1 basis if you wish to withdraw the funds.</p>\n<p>Now let’s shift focus to options trades held to expiry.</p>\n<h4><em><strong>Call option, Long, held to expiry</strong></em></h4>\n<p>In the money (ITM), options held to expiry get physically settled. If the option is OTM, then the buyer loses the premium paid, and the seller gets to retain the entire premium received at the time of writing the option.</p>\n<p>We have discussed the physical settlement in <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/quick-note-on-physical-settlement/\"><strong>detail in this chapter</strong></a>. However, for the sake of completeness, let’s quickly discuss only the P&amp;L part.</p>\n<p>Calculating the P&amp;L if you hold a long call position to expiry is a little tricky since the stock options as physically settled.</p>\n<p>Continuing with the above example, assume the settlement price of Reliance is 2650 upon expiry. The 2500 option is In the money (ITM); hence physically settled. Since it’s a call option, the option buyer has the right to buy Reliance at the strike price, i.e. 2500.  Premium paid is 76.</p>\n<p>The effective price at which you get the shares is strike price + premium paid. In this case,</p>\n<p>2500 + 76</p>\n<p>= 2576</p>\n<p>Assuming the stock price on Monday is 2650, the profit you’ll make here is –</p>\n<p>2650 – 2576</p>\n<p>= 74</p>\n<p>As you know, the expiry of derivatives is on the last Thursday of the month; the delivery of shares happen on a T+2 basis. Hence the shares are delivered on the following Monday.</p>\n<h4><em><strong>Call option short, held to expiry</strong></em></h4>\n<p>The call option seller sells the 2500 CE at 76. Here the option seller has to give delivery of shares. The price at which the seller gives delivery is 2500, but since the seller receives a premium of 76, the effective price is –</p>\n<p>2500 + 76</p>\n<p>= 2576.</p>\n<p>The stock is trading at 2650, but the seller sells the same at 2576. The loss for the option writer is –</p>\n<p>2650 – 2576</p>\n<p>= 74.</p>\n<p>The shares will be debited from the seller’s Demat account and credited to the buyer’s Demat account.</p>\n<h4><em><strong>Put option, Long, held to expiry</strong></em></h4>\n<p>Let us change the example from Reliance to TCS, to break the monotony 😊</p>\n<p>Here are the trade details –</p>\n<p>Underlying = TCS</p>\n<p>Strike = 3520</p>\n<p>Premium = 55</p>\n<p>Option type = Put</p>\n<p>Position = long</p>\n<p>Settlement price = 3390</p>\n<p>Since the settlement price is 3390, 3520 is an ‘In the Money’ (ITM) option, hence physically settled. The buyer of a put option has the right to sell the put option or give delivery of shares.</p>\n<p>The put option buyer will give the delivery of shares at 3520, but since the put buyer has paid a premium, the effective price for delivery is –</p>\n<p>Strike – Premium</p>\n<p>= 3520 – 55</p>\n<p>= 3465</p>\n<p>The put seller gets to sell the stock at 3465 when the same stock is trading at 3390. The gain here is –</p>\n<p>3465 – 3390</p>\n<p>= 75.</p>\n<h4><em><strong>Put option short, held to expiry</strong></em></h4>\n<p>Continuing the same example, the put option seller has to take delivery of shares. The delivery price is the settlement price, i.e. 3390, but the seller has received the premium. Adjusting for that, the effective ‘take delivery’ price is –</p>\n<p>Strike – premium</p>\n<p>= 3520 – 55</p>\n<p>= 3465</p>\n<p>The put option seller has to take delivery of shares at an effective price of 3465 when the same underlying is available at 3390 in the market. Hence the loss here is 75.</p>\n<p>Of course, physical settlement of options is net off if you have two opposite ITM positions. For example, if you have a spread position in which the ‘give delivery’ obligation arising out of one option offsets another option position, that has to take delivery obligation. I’d suggest you read this chapter to <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/quick-note-on-physical-settlement/\"><strong>learn about position offsets</strong></a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>Key takeaways from this chapter</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Neither option buying nor selling entails mark to market; M2M is only for futures</li>\n<li>Margins charged for option selling is a function of both price movement and volatility</li>\n<li>As volatility increases, so does the option premium</li>\n<li>Option positions closed before expiry can be generalized to the Difference between buying and selling price of premium multiplied by lot size</li>\n<li>The option positions held to expiry are physically settled</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

The article was titled “Why winning is addictive”.</p>\n<p>Here is the article, authored by B.Venkatesh (a regular columnist for HBL) –</p>\n<p><em>“</em>To buy and bet on a lottery ticket – a game that you typically avoid because you understand the odds of winning the jackpot is really low. However, if you do win the ticket, you will be most likely tempted to buy a lottery ticket regularly thereafter!</p>\n<p>We exhibit similar behavior when it comes to our investments as well. What drives such behavior? As humans, our life is governed by anticipation. So, looking forward to winning a lottery is exciting and so is realizing that expectation.</p>\n<p>Research in neuroscience has however shown that anticipating a win is more exciting than actual winning! Nevertheless, once you experience the excitement of winning a lottery you feel the need to indulge. That is, your brain compels you to buy a lottery ticket, even though you are aware of the odds of winning the second one.</p>\n<p>This happens because we tend to use more of reflexive brain than reflective brain. The reflective brain performs calculation that helps you analyze and think. The reflexive brain helps you feel and is more intuitive. When you feel an urge to buy a lottery ticket, it is your reflexive brain that is pushing you to do so. Your reflective brain is likely to tell you that the odds of winning the jackpot for the second time are low!</p>\n<p>Now consider trading in equity options. You know that buying calls and puts has its risk, as options often expire worthless. Yet we may choose to buy them regularly, especially if we have already experienced large gains from such investments, for it is the reflexive brain in action. With trading options there is another factor at play. We know that options carry the risk of losing capital when our view on the underlying stock or the index turns wrong.</p>\n<p>The fact that we can lose money makes our experience of winning against such odds even more exciting! This is not so much true of lottery because a lottery is a game of chance while investments, we believe, require some degree of skill<em>”</em></p>\n<p>–End of article–</p>\n<p>You maybe be wondering, why I chose to post the above article right at the beginning of this module. Well, this article echoes some of my own thoughts; in fact it goes a step further to put things in the behavioral finance context. From the many interactions that I’ve have had with both experienced and aspiring options traders, one point is quite common – most options traders  treat options trading as a ‘hit or miss” kind of a trade. There is always a sense of amusement when one initiates an option trade, many don’t realize how fatal this naïve amusement can be.</p>\n<p>Traders buy options (month after month) with a hope they would double their investment. Trading options with such a mindset is a perfect recipe for a P&amp;L disaster. The bottom line is this – if you aspire to trade options, you need to do it the right way and follow the right approach. Else you can be rest assured the gambling attitude will eventually consume your entire trading capital and you will end up having a short, self destructive option trading career.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M6-C1-cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2804\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/M6-C1-cartoon.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/M6-C1-cartoon.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/M6-C1-cartoon-300x200.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>I do have to mention this now – the common phrase that goes like this (w.r.t options) “limited risk, unlimited profit potential” is a silent P&amp;L killer. Newbie traders are disillusioned by this ‘theoretically correct’ but practically disastrous fact and thereby end up blowing up their books, slowly and steadily. Hence I do believe that trading options blindly without a strategy is a “dangerous but irresistible pass time”  ☺ (courtesy – Pink Floyd).</p>\n<p>I don’t intend to scare you with this note; I’m only trying to set the context here. With the previous module on Options Theory, I’m sure you would have realized that unlike other topics in the markets, the science involved in Options is heavy duty. It can be quite overwhelming, but you will have to trust me here – the only way to understand and master options trading is by structuring your learning path with a good judicious mix of theory and practice.</p>\n<p>In this module, I will attempt to give you a good overview of what you really need to know about some of the popular options strategies. Like always, I will try and stick to the practical aspect and ignore the unwanted (and confusing) theory part.</p>\n<p>As far as I’m aware, there are close to 475 options strategies out there in the public domain and I’m sure at least another 100 odd strategies are hidden in the proprietary books of brokers, bankers, and traders. Given this should you know all these strategies put up in the public domain?</p>\n<p>Answer is a simple no.</p>\n<h2>1.2 – What should you know?</h2>\n<p>You only need to know a handful of strategies but you need to know them really well. Once you know these strategies all you need to do is analyze the current state of markets (or the stock) and map it with the right option strategy from your strategy quiver.</p>\n<p>Keeping this in perspective we will discuss certain strategies.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"top\"><img alt=\"bullish-strategies\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2805 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/bullish-strategies.png\" width=\"140\"/><br/>\n<strong>Bullish Strategies</strong>\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Bull Call Spread</li>\n<li>Bull Put Spread</li>\n<li>Call Ratio Back Spread</li>\n<li>Bear Call Ladder</li>\n<li>Call Butterfly</li>\n<li>Synthetic Call</li>\n<li>Straps</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><img alt=\"bearish-strategies\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2806\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/bearish-strategies.png\" width=\"140\"/><br/>\n<strong>Bearish Spreads</strong>\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Bear Call Spread</li>\n<li>Bear Put Spread</li>\n<li>Bull Put Ladder</li>\n<li>Put Ratio Back spread</li>\n<li>Strip</li>\n<li>Synthetic Put</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n<td valign=\"top\"><img alt=\"neutral-strategies\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2807\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/neutral-strategies.png\" width=\"140\"/><br/>\n<strong>Neutral Strategies</strong>\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\n<li>Long &amp; Short Straddles</li>\n<li>Long &amp; Short Strangles</li>\n<li>Long &amp; Short Iron Condor</li>\n<li>Long &amp; Short Butterfly</li>\n<li>Box</li>\n</ol>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Besides discussing the above strategies I also intend to discuss –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Max Pain for option writing – (some key observations and practical aspects)</li>\n<li>Volatility Arbitrage employing Dynamic Delta hedging</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The plan is to discuss one option strategy per chapter so that there is ample clarity about the strategy, without any mix up or confusion. This means to say we will have roughly about 20 chapters in this module, although I suppose each chapter would not be too lengthy.

None of the strategies that we discuss here in the module is sure shot money making machine; in fact nothing is in the markets. The objective here in this module is to ensure that we discuss few basic but important strategies, if you deploy them right you can make money.</p>\n<p>Think about this way – if you have a nice car and drive it properly, you can use it to commute and ensure comfort of yourself and your family. However if you are rash with the car, then it can be dangerous to you and everyone else around you.</p>\n<p>Likewise these strategies make money if you use it right; if you don’t then they can create a hole in your P&amp;L. My job here is to help you understand these strategies (help you learn how to drive the car) and I will also attempt to explain the best condition under which you can use these strategies. But making sure it works for you is in your control, this really depends on your discipline and reading of markets. Having said this, I’m reasonably certain your application of strategies will improve as and when you spend more ‘quality’ time in the markets.</p>\n<p>So starting from the next chapter we focus on the Bullish strategies with the ‘Bull Call Spread’ making its debut.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned.</p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>2.1 – Background</h2>\n<p>The spread strategies are some of the simplest option strategies that a trader can implement. Spreads are multi leg strategies involving 2 or more options. When I say multi leg strategies, it implies the strategy requires 2 or more option transactions.</p>\n<p>Spread strategy such as the ‘Bull Call Spread’ is best implemented when your outlook on the stock/index is ‘moderate’ and not really ‘aggressive’. For example the outlook on a particular stock could be ‘moderately bullish’ or ‘moderately bearish’.</p>\n<p>Some of the typical scenarios where your outlook can turn ‘moderately bullish’ are outlined as below –</p>\n<p><strong>Fundamental perspective</strong> – Reliance Industries is expected to make its Q3 quarterly results announcement. From the management’s Q2 quarterly guidance you know that the Q3 results are expected to be better than both Q2 and Q3 of last year. However you do not know by how many basis points the results will be better. This is clearly the missing part of the puzzle.</p>\n<p>Given this you expect the stock price to react positively to the result announcement. However because the guidance was laid out in Q2 the market could have kind of factored in the news. This leads you to think that the stock can go up, but with a limited upside.</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Perspective</strong> – The stock that you are tracking has been in the down trend for a while, so much so that it is at a 52 week low, testing the 200 day moving average, and also near a multi-year support. Given all this there is a high probability that the stock could stage a relief rally. However you are not completely bullish as whatever said and done the stock is still in a downtrend.</p>\n<p><strong>Quantitative Perspective – </strong>The stock is consistently trading between the 1<sup>st</sup> standard deviation both ways (+1 SD &amp; -1 SD), exhibiting a consistent mean reverting behavior. However there has been a sudden decline in the stock price, so much so that the stock price is now at the 2<sup>nd</sup> standard deviation. There is no fundamental reason backing the stock price decline, hence there is a good chance that the stock price could revert to mean. This makes you bullish on the stock, but the fact that it there is a chance that it could spend more time near the 2<sup>nd</sup> SD before reverting to mean caps your bullish outlook on the stock.</p>\n<p>The point here is – your perspective could be developed from any theory (fundamental, technical, or quantitative) and you could find yourself in a ‘moderately bullish’ stance. In fact this is true for a ‘moderately bearish’ stance as well. In such a situation you can simply invoke a spread strategy wherein you can set up option positions in such a way that</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You protect yourself on the downside (in case you are proved wrong)</li>\n<li>The amount of profit that you make is also predefined (capped)</li>\n<li>As a trade off (for capping your profits) you get to participate in the market for a lesser cost</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> point could be a little confusing at this stage; you will get clarity on it as we proceed.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_2856\" style=\"width: 610px\"><img alt=\"M6-C2-Bull Call Spread\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2856\" class=\"wp-image-2856 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/M6-C2-cartoon.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/M6-C2-cartoon.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/M6-C2-cartoon-300x200.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-2856\">Bull Call Spread</p></div>\n<h2>2.2 – Strategy notes</h2>\n<p>Amongst all the spread strategies, the bull call spread is one the most popular one. The strategy comes handy when you have a moderately bullish view on the stock/index.</p>\n<p>The bull call spread is a two leg spread strategy traditionally involving ATM and OTM options. However you can create the bull call spread using other strikes as well.</p>\n<p>To implement the bull call spread –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy 1 ATM call option (leg 1)</li>\n<li>Sell 1 OTM call option (leg 2)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you do this ensure –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All strikes belong to the same underlying</li>\n<li>Belong to the same expiry series</li>\n<li>Each leg involves the same number of options</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example –</p>\n<p>Date – 23<sup>rd</sup> November 2015</p>\n<p>Outlook – Moderately bullish (expect the market to go higher but the expiry around the corner could limit the upside)</p>\n<p>Nifty Spot – 7846</p>\n<p>ATM – 7800 CE, premium – Rs.79/-</p>\n<p>OTM – 7900 CE, premium – Rs.25/-</p>\n<p>Bull Call Spread, trade set up –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy 7800 CE by paying 79 towards the premium. Since money is going out of my account this is a debit transaction</li>\n<li>Sell 7900 CE and receive 25 as premium. Since I receive money, this is a credit transaction</li>\n<li>The net cash flow is the difference between the debit and credit i.e 79 – 25 = <strong>54</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Generally speaking in a bull call spread there is always a ‘net debit’, hence the bull call spread is also called referred to as a ‘debit bull spread’.</p>\n<p>After we initiate the trade, the market can move in any direction and expiry at any level. Therefore let us take up a few scenarios to get a sense of what would happen to the bull call spread for different levels of expiry.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7700 (below the lower strike price i.e ATM option)</strong></p>\n<p>The value of the call options would depend upon its intrinsic value. If you recall from the previous module, the intrinsic value of a call option upon expiry is –</p>\n<p>Max [0, Spot-Strike]</p>\n<p>In case of 7800 CE, the intrinsic value would be –</p>\n<p>Max [0, 7700 – 7800]</p>\n<p>= Max [0, -100]</p>\n<p>= 0</p>\n<p>Since the 7800 (ATM) call option has 0 intrinsic value we would lose the entire premium paid i.e  Rs.79/-</p>\n<p>The 7900 CE option also has 0 intrinsic value, but since we have sold/written this option we get to retain the premium of Rs.25.</p>\n<p>So our net payoff from this would be –</p>\n<p>-79 + 25</p>\n<p>= <strong>54</strong></p>\n<p>Do note, this is also the <strong>net debit</strong> of the overall strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7800 (at the lower strike price i.e the ATM option) </strong></p>\n<p>I will skip the math here, but you need to know that both 7800 and 7900 would have 0 intrinsic value, therefore the net loss would be 54.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7900 (at the higher strike price, i.e the OTM option)</strong></p>\n<p>The intrinsic value of the 7800 CE would be –</p>\n<p>Max [0, Spot-Strike]</p>\n<p>= Max [0, 7900 – 7800]</p>\n<p>= 100</p>\n<p>Since we are long on this option by paying a premium of 79, we would make a profit of –</p>\n<p>100 -79</p>\n<p>= 21</p>\n<p>The intrinsic value of 7900 CE would be 0, therefore we get to retain the premium Rs.25/-</p>\n<p>Net profit would be 21 + 25 = <strong>46</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 4 – Market expires at 8000 (above the higher strike price, i.e the OTM option)</strong></p>\n<p>Both the options would have a positive intrinsic value</p>\n<p>7800 CE would have an intrinsic value of 200, and the 7900 CE would have an intrinsic value of 100.</p>\n<p>On the 7800 CE we would make 200 – 79 = 121 in profit</p>\n<p>And on the 7900 CE we would lose 100 – 25 = 75</p>\n<p>The overall profit would be</p>\n<p>121 – 75</p>\n<p>= <strong>46</strong></p>\n<p>To summarize –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Market Expiry</th>\n<th>LS – IV</th>\n<th>HS – IV</th>\n<th>Net pay off</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7700</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>(54)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7800</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>(54)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7900</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>+46</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8000</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>+46</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>From this, 2 things should be clear to you –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Irrespective of the down move in the market, the loss is restricted to Rs.54, the maximum loss also happens to be the ‘<strong>net debit</strong>’ of the strategy</li>\n<li>The maximum profit is capped to 46. This also happens to be the difference between the spread and strategy’s net debit</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can define the ‘<strong>Spread</strong>’ as –</p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #b5b2ea; color: white;\">Spread = Difference between the higher and lower strike price</span></p>\n<p>We can calculate the overall profitability of the strategy for any given expiry value. Here is screenshot of the calculations that I made on the excel sheet –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-1_Payoff.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_Payoff\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2852\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"326\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-1_Payoff.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-1_Payoff.png 800w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-1_Payoff-300x122.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>LS – IV – Lower Strike – Intrinsic value (7800 CE, ATM)</em></li>\n<li><em>PP – Premium Paid</em></li>\n<li><em>LS Payoff – Lower Strike Payoff</em></li>\n<li><em>HS-IV – Higher strike – Intrinsic Value (7900 CE, OTM)</em></li>\n<li><em>PR – Premium Received</em></li>\n<li><em>HS Payoff – Higher Strike Payoff</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can notice, the loss is restricted to Rs.54, and the profit is capped to 46.

However the loss is restricted to Rs.54.</li>\n<li>The breakeven point (where the strategy neither make a profit or loss) is achieved when the market expires at 7854 (7800 + 54). Therefore we can generalize the breakeven point for a bull call spread as <strong>Lower Strike + Net Debit</strong></li>\n<li>The strategy makes money if the market moves above 7854, however the maximum profit achievable is Rs.46 i.e the difference between the strikes minus the net debit\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>7900 – 7800 = 100</li>\n<li>100 – 54 = 46</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I suppose at this stage you may be wondering why anyone would choose to implement a bull call spread versus buying a plain vanilla call option. Well, the main reason is the reduced strategy cost.</p>\n<p>Do remember your outlook is ‘moderately bullish’. Given this buying an OTM option is ruled out. If you were to buy the ATM option you would have to pay Rs.79 as the option premium and if the market proves you wrong, you stand to lose Rs.79. However by implementing a bull call spread you reduce the overall cost to Rs.54 from Rs.79. As a tradeoff you also cap your upside. In my view this is a fair deal considering you are not aggressively bullish on the stock/index.</p>\n<h2>2.3 – Strike Selection</h2>\n<p>How would you quantify moderately bullish/bearish? Would you consider a 5% move on Infosys as moderately bullish move, or should it be 10% and above? What about the index such as Bank Nifty and Nifty 50? What about mid caps stocks such as Yes Bank, Mindtree, Strides Arcolab etc? Well, clearly there is no one shoe fits all solution here. One can attempt to quantify the ‘moderate-ness’ of the move by evaluating the stock/index volatility.</p>\n<p>Based on volatility I have devised a few rules (works alright for me) you may want to improvise on it further – If the stock is highly volatile, then I would consider a move of 5-8% as ‘moderate’. However if the stock is not very volatile I would consider sub 5% as ‘moderate’. For indices I would consider sub 5% as moderate.</p>\n<p>Now consider this – you have a ‘moderately bullish’ view on Nifty 50 (sub 5% move), given this which are the strikes to select for the bull call spread? Is the ATM + OTM combo the best possible spread?</p>\n<p>The answer to this depends on good old Theta!</p>\n<p>Here are a bunch of graphs that will help you identify the best possible strikes based on time to expiry.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-3_first-half-of-series2.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_first half of series\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2864\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"450\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-3_first-half-of-series2-1024x576.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-3_first-half-of-series2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-3_first-half-of-series2-300x169.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-3_first-half-of-series2.png 1280w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Before understanding the graphs above a few things to note –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Nifty spot is assumed to be at 8000</li>\n<li>Start of the series is defined as anytime during the first 15 days of the series</li>\n<li>End of the series is defined as anytime during the last 15 days of the series</li>\n<li>The bull call spread is optimized and the spread is created with 300 points difference</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The thought here is that the market will move up moderately by about 3.75% i.e from 8000 to 8300. So considering the move and the time to expiry, the graphs above suggest –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Graph 1 (top left)</strong> – You are at the start of the expiry series and you expect the move over the next <strong>5 days</strong>, then a bull spread with far OTM is most profitable i.e 8600 (lower strike long) and 8900 (higher strike short)</li>\n<li><strong>Graph 2 (top right)</strong> – You are at the start of the expiry series and you expect the move over the next <strong>15 days</strong>, then a bull spread with slightly OTM is most profitable i.e 8200 and 8500</li>\n<li><strong>Graph 3 (bottom left) </strong>– You are at the start of the expiry series and you expect the move in <strong>25 days</strong>, then a bull spread with ATM is most profitable i.e 8000 and 8300. It is also interesting to note that the strikes above 8200 (OTM options) make a loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Graph 4 (bottom right) </strong>– You are at the start of the expiry series and you expect the move to occur <strong>by expiry</strong>, then a bull spread with ATM is most profitable i.e 8000 and 8300. Do note, the losses with OTM and far OTM options deepen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are another bunch of charts; the only difference is that for the same move (i.e 3.75%) these charts suggest the best possible strikes to select assuming you are in the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-4_2nd-half-of-series2.png\"><img alt=\"Image 4_2nd half of series\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2865\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"450\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-4_2nd-half-of-series2-1024x576.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-4_2nd-half-of-series2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-4_2nd-half-of-series2-300x169.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Image-4_2nd-half-of-series2.png 1280w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Graph 1 (top left)</strong> – If you expect a moderate move during the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series, and you expect the move to happen within <strong>a day (or two)</strong> then the best strikes to opt are far OTM i.e 8600 (lower strike long) and 8900 (higher strike short)</li>\n<li><strong>Graph 2 (top right)</strong> – If you expect a moderate move during the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series, and you expect the move to happen over the next <strong>5 days</strong> then the best strikes to opt are far OTM i.e 8600 (lower strike long) and 8900 (higher strike short). Do note, both Graph 1 and 2 are suggesting the same strikes, but the profitability of the strategy reduces, thanks to the effect of Theta!</li>\n<li><strong>Graph 3 (bottom right) </strong>– If you expect a moderate move during the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series, and you expect the move to happen over the next <strong>10 days</strong> then the best strikes to opt are slightly OTM (1 strike away from ATM)</li>\n<li><strong>Graph 4 (bottom left) </strong>– If you expect a moderate move during the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series, and you expect the move to happen on <strong>expiry day</strong>, then the best strikes to opt are ATM i.e 8000 (lower strike, long) and 8300 (higher strike, short). Do note, far OTM options lose money even if the market moves up.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>2.3 – Creating Spreads</strong></p>\n<p>Here is something you should know, wider the spread, higher is the amount of money you can potentially make, but as a trade off the breakeven also increases.</p>\n<p>To illustrate –</p>\n<p>Today is 28<sup>th</sup> November, the first day of the December series. Nifty spot is at 7883, consider 3 different bull call spreads –</p>\n<p><strong>Set 1 – Bull call spread with ITM and ATM strikes </strong></p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower Strike (ITM, Long)</td>\n<td>7700</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher Strike (ATM, short)</td>\n<td>7800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spread</td>\n<td>7800 – 7700 = 100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower Strike Premium Paid</td>\n<td>296</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher Strike Premium Received</td>\n<td>227</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net Debit</td>\n<td>296 – 227 = 69</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Loss (same as net debit)</td>\n<td>69</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Profit (Spread – Net Debit)</td>\n<td>100 – 69 = 31</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Breakeven</td>\n<td>7700 + 69 = 7769</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Remarks</td>\n<td>Considering the outlook is moderately bullish,<br/>\n7769 breakeven is easily achievable,<br/>\nhowever the max profit is 31,<br/>\nskewing the risk (69 pts) to reward (31 pts) ratio.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Set 2 – Bull call spread with ATM and OTM strikes (classic combo)</strong></p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower Strike (ATM, Long)</td>\n<td>7800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher Strike (ATM, short)</td>\n<td>7900</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spread</td>\n<td>7900 – 7800 = 100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower Strike Premium Paid</td>\n<td>227</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher Strike Premium Received</td>\n<td>167</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net Debit</td>\n<td>227 – 167 = 60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Loss (same as net debit)</td>\n<td>60</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Profit (Spread – Net Debit)</td>\n<td>100 – 60 = 40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Breakeven</td>\n<td>7800 + 60 = 7860</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Remarks</td>\n<td>Risk reward is better, but the breakeven is higher</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Set 3 – Bull call spread with OTM and OTM strikes </strong></p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower Strike (ATM, Long)</td>\n<td>7900</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher Strike (ATM, short)</td>\n<td>8000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spread</td>\n<td>8000 – 7900 = 100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower Strike Premium Paid</td>\n<td>167</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher Strike Premium Received</td>\n<td>116</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net Debit</td>\n<td>167 – 116 = 51</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Loss (same as net debit)</td>\n<td>51</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Profit (Spread – Net Debit)</td>\n<td>100 – 51 = 49</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Breakeven</td>\n<td>7900 + 51 = 7951</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Remarks</td>\n<td>Risk reward is attractive, but the breakeven is higher</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So the point is that, the risk reward changes based on the strikes that you choose.

The Bull Put Spread is similar to the Bull Call Spread in terms of the payoff structure; however there are a few differences in terms of strategy execution and strike selection. The bull put spread involves creating a spread by employing ‘Put options’ rather than ‘Call options’ (as is the case in bull call spread).</p>\n<p>You may have a fundamental question at this stage – when the payoffs from both Bull call spread and Bull Put spread are similar, why should one choose a certain strategy over the other?</p>\n<p>Well, this really depends on how attractive the premiums are. While the Bull Call spread is executed for a <strong>debit</strong>, the bull put spread is executed for a <strong>credit</strong>. So if you are at a point in the market where –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The markets have declined considerably (therefore PUT premiums have swelled)</li>\n<li>The volatility is on the higher side</li>\n<li>There is plenty of time to expiry</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And you have a moderately bullish outlook looking ahead, then it makes sense to invoke a Bull Put Spread for a net credit as opposed to invoking a Bull Call Spread for a net debit. Personally I do prefer strategies which offer net credit rather than strategies which offer net debit.</p>\n<h2>3.2 – Strategy Notes</h2>\n<p>The bull put spread is a two leg spread strategy traditionally involving ITM and OTM Put options. However you can create the spread using other strikes as well.</p>\n<p>To implement the bull put spread –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy 1 OTM Put option (leg 1)</li>\n<li>Sell 1 ITM Put option (leg 2)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you do this ensure –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All strikes belong to the same underlying</li>\n<li>Belong to the same expiry series</li>\n<li>Each leg involves the same number of options</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example –</p>\n<p>Date – 7<sup>th</sup> December 2015</p>\n<p>Outlook – Moderately bullish (expect the market to go higher)</p>\n<p>Nifty Spot – 7805</p>\n<p>Bull Put Spread, trade set up –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Buy 7700 PE</strong> by paying Rs.72/- as premium; do note this is an OTM option. Since money is going out of my account this is a debit transaction</li>\n<li><strong>Sell 7900 PE</strong> and receive Rs.163/- as premium, do note this is an ITM option. Since I receive money, this is a credit transaction</li>\n<li>The net cash flow is the difference between the debit and credit i.e 163 – 72 = <strong>+91,</strong> since this is a positive cashflow, there is a net credit to my account.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Generally speaking in a bull put spread there is always a ‘net credit’, hence the bull put spread is also called referred to as a ‘Credit spread’.</p>\n<p>After we initiate the trade, the market can move in any direction and expiry at any level. Therefore let us take up a few scenarios to get a sense of what would happen to the bull put spread for different levels of expiry.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7600 (below the lower strike price i.e OTM option)</strong></p>\n<p>The value of the Put options at expiry depends upon its intrinsic value. If you recall from the previous module, the intrinsic value of a put option upon expiry is –</p>\n<p>Max [Strike-Spot, o]</p>\n<p>In case of 7700 PE, the intrinsic value would be –</p>\n<p>Max [7700 – 7600 – 0]</p>\n<p>= Max [100, 0]</p>\n<p>= 100</p>\n<p>Since we are long on the 7700 PE by paying a premium of Rs.72, we would make</p>\n<p>= Intrinsic Value – Premium Paid</p>\n<p>= 100 – 72</p>\n<p>= 28</p>\n<p>Likewise, in case of the 7900 PE option it has an intrinsic value of 300, but since we have sold/written this option at Rs.163</p>\n<p>Payoff from 7900 PE this would be –</p>\n<p>163 – 300</p>\n<p>= – <strong>137</strong></p>\n<p>Overall strategy payoff would be –</p>\n<p>+ 28 – 137</p>\n<p>= <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 109</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7700 (at the lower strike price i.e the OTM option) </strong></p>\n<p>The 7700 PE will not have any intrinsic value, hence we will lose all the premium that we have paid i.e Rs.72.</p>\n<p>The 7900 PE’s intrinsic value will be Rs.200.</p>\n<p>Net Payoff from the strategy would be –</p>\n<p>Premium received from selling 7900PE – Intrinsic value of  7900 PE – Premium lost on 7700 PE</p>\n<p>= 163 – 200 – 72</p>\n<p>= <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 109</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7900 (at the higher strike price, i.e ITM option)</strong></p>\n<p>The intrinsic value of both 7700 PE and 7900 PE would be 0, hence both the potions would expire worthless.</p>\n<p>Net Payoff from the strategy would be –</p>\n<p>Premium received for 7900 PE – Premium Paid for 7700 PE</p>\n<p>= 163 – 72</p>\n<p>= <strong>+ 91</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 4 – Market expires at 8000 (above the higher strike price, i.e the ITM option)</strong></p>\n<p>Both the options i.e 7700 PE and 7900 PE would expire worthless, hence the total strategy payoff would be</p>\n<p>Premium received for 7900 PE – Premium Paid for 7700 PE</p>\n<p>= 163 – 72</p>\n<p>= <strong>+ 91</strong></p>\n<p>To summarize –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Market Expiry</th>\n<th>7700 PE (intrinsic value)</th>\n<th>7900 PE (intrinsic value)</th>\n<th>Net pay off</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7600</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>300</td>\n<td>-109</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7700</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>-109</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7900</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>91</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8000</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>91</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>From this analysis, 3 things should be clear to you –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The strategy is profitable as and when the market moves higher</li>\n<li>Irrespective of the down move in the market, the loss is restricted to Rs.109, the maximum loss also happens to be the difference between “<strong>Spread and net credit</strong>’ of the strategy</li>\n<li>The maximum profit is capped to 91.

However, the loss is restricted to Rs.109.</li>\n<li>The breakeven point (where the strategy neither makes a profit or loss) is achieved when the market expires at 7809. Therefore we can generalize the breakeven point for a Bull Put spread as <strong style=\"background-color: #b5b2ea; color: white;\">Higher Strike – Net Credit</strong></li>\n<li>The strategy makes money if the market moves above 7809, however the maximum profit achievable is Rs.91 i.e the difference between the Premium Received for ITM PE and the Premium Paid for the OTM PE\n<ol style=\"list-style: a;\">\n<li>Premium Paid for 7700 PE = 72</li>\n<li>Premium Received for 7900 PE = 163</li>\n<li>Net Credit = 163 – 72 = 91</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>3.3 – Other Strike combinations</h2>\n<p>Remember the <strong>spread</strong> is defined as the difference between the two strike prices. The Bull Put Spread is always created with 1 OTM Put and 1 ITM Put option, however, the strikes that you choose can be any OTM and any ITM strike. The further these strikes are the larger the spread, the larger the spread the larger is the possible reward.</p>\n<p>Let us take some examples considering spot is at 7612 –</p>\n<p><strong>Bull Put spread with 7500 PE (OTM) and 7700 PE (ITM)</strong></p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower Strike (OTM, Long)</td>\n<td>7500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher Strike (ITM, short)</td>\n<td>7700</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spread</td>\n<td>7700 – 7500 = <strong>200</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower Strike Premium Paid</td>\n<td>62</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher Strike Premium Received</td>\n<td>137</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net Credit</td>\n<td>137 – 62 = <strong>75</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Loss (Spread – Net Credit)</td>\n<td>200 – 75 = <strong>125</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Profit (Net Credit)</td>\n<td>75</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Breakeven (Higher Strike – Net Credit)</td>\n<td>7700 – 75 = <strong>7625</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Bull Put spread with 7400 PE (OTM) and 7800 PE (ITM)</strong></p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower Strike (OTM, Long)</td>\n<td>7400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher Strike (ITM, short)</td>\n<td>7800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spread</td>\n<td>7800 – 7400 = <strong>400</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower Strike Premium Paid</td>\n<td>40</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher Strike Premium Received</td>\n<td>198</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net Credit</td>\n<td>198 – 40 = <strong>158</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Loss (Spread – Net Credit)</td>\n<td>400 – 158 = 242</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Profit (Net Credit)</td>\n<td>158</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Breakeven (Higher Strike – Net Credit)</td>\n<td>7800 – 158 = <strong>7642</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Bull Put spread with 7500 PE (OTM) and 7800 PE (ITM)</strong></p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower Strike (OTM, Long)</td>\n<td>7500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher Strike (ITM, short)</td>\n<td>7800</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spread</td>\n<td>7800 – 7500 = <strong>300</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Lower Strike Premium Paid</td>\n<td>62</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Higher Strike Premium Received</td>\n<td>198</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Net Credit</td>\n<td>198 – 62 = <strong>136</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Loss (Spread – Net Credit)</td>\n<td>300 – 136 = 164</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Max Profit (Net Credit)</td>\n<td>136</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Breakeven (Higher Strike – Net Credit)</td>\n<td>7800 – 136 = <strong>7664</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So the point here is that, you can create the spread with any combination of OTM and ITM option. However based on the strikes that you choose (and therefore the spread you create), the risk reward ratio changes. In general, if you have a high conviction on a ‘moderately bullish’ view then go ahead and create a larger spread; else stick to a smaller spread.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The Bull Put Spread is an alternative to the Bull Call Spread.

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>4.1 – Background</h2>\n<p>The Call Ratio Back Spread is an interesting options strategy. I call this interesting keeping in mind the simplicity of implementation and the kind of pay off it offers the trader. This should certainly have a spot in your strategy arsenal. The strategy is deployed when one is out rightly bullish on a stock (or index), unlike the bull call spread or bull put spread where one is moderately bullish.</p>\n<p>At a broad level this is what you will experience when you implement the Call Ratio Back Spread-</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unlimited profit if the market goes up</li>\n<li>Limited profit if market goes down</li>\n<li>A predefined loss if the market stay within a range</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In simpler words you can get to make money as long as the market moves in either direction.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/M6-Ch4-cartoon.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2933 size-full\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/M6-Ch4-cartoon.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/M6-Ch4-cartoon.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/M6-Ch4-cartoon-300x200.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></a></p>\n<p>Usually, the Call Ratio Back Spread is deployed for a ‘net credit’, meaning money flows into your account as soon as you execute Call Ratio Back Spread. The ‘net credit’ is what you make if the market goes down, as opposed to your expectation (i.e market going up). On the other hand, if the market indeed goes up, then you stand to make an unlimited profit. I suppose this should also explain why the call ratio spread is better than buying a plain vanilla call option.</p>\n<p>So let’s go ahead and figure out how this works.</p>\n<h2>4.2 – Strategy Notes</h2>\n<p>The Call Ratio Back Spread is a 3 leg option strategy as it involves <strong>buying two OTM</strong> call option and <strong>selling one ITM</strong> Call option. This is the classic 2:1 combo. In fact the call ratio back spread has to be executed in the 2:1 ratio meaning 2 options bought for every one option sold, or 4 options bought for every 2 option sold, so on and so forth.</p>\n<p>Let take an example – assume Nifty Spot is at 7743 and you expect Nifty to hit 8100 by the end of expiry. This is clearly a bullish outlook on the market. To implement the Call Ratio Back Spread –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sell <strong>one</strong> lot of 7600 CE (ITM)</li>\n<li>Buy <strong>two</strong> lots of 7800 CE (OTM)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Make sure –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Call options belong to the same expiry</li>\n<li>Belongs to the same underlying</li>\n<li>The ratio is maintained</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The trade set up looks like this –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>7600 CE, one lot short, the premium received for this is Rs.201/-</li>\n<li>7800 CE, two lots long, the premium paid is Rs.78/- per lot, so Rs.156/- for 2 lots</li>\n<li>Net Cash flow is = Premium Received – Premium Paid i.e 201 – 156 = <strong>45</strong> (Net Credit)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With these trades, the call ratio back spread is executed. Let us check what would happen to the overall cash flow of the strategies at different levels of expiry.</p>\n<p>Do note we need to evaluate the strategy payoff at various levels of expiry as the strategy payoff is quite versatile.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7400 (below the lower strike price)</strong></p>\n<p>We know the intrinsic value of a call option (upon expiry) is –</p>\n<p>Max [Spot – Strike, 0]</p>\n<p>The 7600 would have an intrinsic value of</p>\n<p>Max [7400 – 7600, 0]</p>\n<p>= 0</p>\n<p>Since we have sold this option, we get to retain the premium received i.e Rs.201</p>\n<p>The intrinsic value of 7800 call option would also be zero; hence we lose the total premium paid i.e Rs.78 per lot or Rs.156 for two lots.</p>\n<p>Net cash flow would Premium Received – Premium paid</p>\n<p>= 201 – 156</p>\n<p>= <strong>45</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7600 (at the lower strike price)</strong></p>\n<p>The intrinsic value of both the call options i.e 7600 and 7800 would be zero, hence both of them expire worthless.</p>\n<p>We get to retain the premium received i.e Rs.201 towards the 7600 CE however we lose Rs.156 on the 7800 CE resulting in a net payoff of <strong>Rs.45.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7645 (at the lower strike price plus net credit)</strong></p>\n<p>You must be wondering why I picked the 7645 level, well this is to showcase the fact that the strategy break even is at this level.</p>\n<p>The intrinsic value of 7600 CE would be –</p>\n<p>Max [Spot – Strike, 0]</p>\n<p>= [7645 – 7600, 0]</p>\n<p>= 45</p>\n<p>Since, we have sold this option for 201 the net pay off from the option would be</p>\n<p>201 – 45</p>\n<p>= 156</p>\n<p>On the other hand we have bought two 7800 CE by paying a premium of 156. Clearly the 7800 CE would expire worthless hence, we lose the entire premium.</p>\n<p>Net payoff would be –</p>\n<p>156 – 156</p>\n<p>= <strong>0</strong></p>\n<p>So at 7645 the strategy neither makes money or loses any money for the trader, hence 7645 is treated as a breakeven point for this trade.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7700 (half way between the lower and higher strike price)</strong></p>\n<p>The 7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 100, and the 7800 would have no intrinsic value.</p>\n<p>On the 7600 CE we get to retain 101, as we would lose 100 from the premium received of 201 i.e 201 – 100 = 101.</p>\n<p>We lose the entire premium of Rs.156 on the 7800 CE, hence the total payoff from the strategy would be</p>\n<p>= 101 – 156</p>\n<p>= <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 55 </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 5 – Market expires at 7800 (at the higher strike price)</strong></p>\n<p>This is an interesting market expiry level, think about it –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At 7800 the 7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 200, and hence we have to let go of the entire premium received i.e 201</li>\n<li>At 7800, the 7800 CE would expire worthless hence we lose the entire premium paid for the 7800 CE i.e Rs.78 per lot, since we have 2 of these we lose Rs.156</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So this is like a ‘double whammy’ point for the strategy!</p>\n<p>The net pay off for the strategy is –</p>\n<p>Premium Received for 7600 CE – Intrinsic value of 7600 CE – Premium Paid for 7800 CE</p>\n<p>= 201 – 200 – 156</p>\n<p>= <strong style=\"color: red;\">-155</strong></p>\n<p>This also happens to be the maximum loss of this strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 6 – Market expires at 7955 (higher strike i.e 7800 + Max loss)</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve deliberately selected this strike to showcase the fact that at 7955 the strategy breakeven!</p>\n<p>But we dealt with a breakeven earlier, you may ask?</p>\n<p>Well, this strategy has two breakeven points – one on the lower side (7645) and another one on the upper side i.e 7955.</p>\n<p>At 7955 the net payoff from the strategy is –</p>\n<p>Premium Received for 7600 CE – Intrinsic value of 7600 CE + (2* Intrinsic value of 7800 CE) – Premium Paid for 7800 CE</p>\n<p>= 201 – 355 + (2*155) – 156</p>\n<p>= 201 – 355 + 310 – 156</p>\n<p>=<strong> 0</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 7 – Market expires at 8100 (higher than the higher strike price, your expected target)</strong></p>\n<p>The 7600 CE will have an intrinsic value of 500, and the 7800 CE will have an intrinsic value of 300.</p>\n<p>The net payoff would be –</p>\n<p>Premium Received for 7600 CE – Intrinsic value of 7600 CE + (2* Intrinsic value of 7800 CE) – Premium Paid for 7800 CE</p>\n<p>= 201 – 500 + (2*300) – 156</p>\n<p>= 201 – 500 + 600 -156</p>\n<p>= <strong>145</strong></p>\n<p>Here are various other levels of expiry, and the eventual payoff from the strategy.

The following graphs show the profitability of the strategy considering the time to expiry and therefore these graphs help the trader select the right strikes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-3_start-of-the-series_1.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2936 size-large\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-3_start-of-the-series_1.png\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Before understanding the graphs above, note the following –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Nifty spot is assumed to be at 8000</li>\n<li>Start of the series is defined as anytime during the first 15 days of the series</li>\n<li>End of the series is defined as anytime during the last 15 days of the series</li>\n<li>The Call Ratio Back Spread is optimized and the spread is created with 300 points difference</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The thought here is that the market will move up by about 6.25% i.e from 8000 to 8500. So considering the move and the time to expiry, the graphs above suggest –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Graph 1 (top left) and Graph 2 (top right)</strong> – You are at the start of the expiry series and you expect the move over the next 5 days (and 15 days in case of Graph 2), then a Call Ratio Spread with 7800 CE (ITM) and 8100 CE (OTM) is the <strong>most profitable</strong> wherein you would sell 7800 CE and buy 2 8100 CE. Do note – even though you would be right on the direction of movement, selecting other far OTM strikes call options tend to lose money</li>\n<li><strong>Graph 3 (bottom left) and Graph 4 (bottom right)</strong> – You are at the start of the expiry series and you expect the move in <strong>25 days </strong>(and expiry day in case of Graph 3), then a Call Ratio Spread with 7800 CE (ITM) and 8100 CE (OTM) is the most profitable wherein you would sell 7800 CE and buy 2 8100 CE.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You must be wondering that the selection of strikes is same irrespective of time to expiry. Well yes, in fact this is the point – Call ratio back spread works best when you sell slightly ITM option and buy slightly OTM option <strong>when there is ample time to expiry</strong>. In fact all other combinations lose money, especially the ones with far OTM options and especially when you expect the target to be achieved closer to the expiry.</p>\n<p>Here are another bunch of charts; the only difference is that the move (i.e 6.25%) occurs during the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-4_2nd-half-of-the-series.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2937 size-large\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-4_2nd-half-of-the-series.png\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Graph 1 (top left) &amp; Graph 2 (top right) </strong>– If you expect the move during the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series, and you expect the move to happen within <strong>a day (or within 5 days, graph 2)</strong> then the best strikes to opt are deep ITM and slightly ITM i.e 7600 (lower strike short) and 7900 (higher strike long). Do note, this is not the classic combo of an ITM + OTM spread, instead this is an ITM and ITM spread! In fact all other combinations don’t work.</li>\n<li><strong>Graph 3 (bottom right) &amp; Graph 4 (bottom left) </strong>– If you expect the move during the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of the series, and you expect the move to happen within <strong>10 days (or on expiry day, graph 4)</strong> then the best strikes to opt are deep ITM and slightly ITM i.e 7600 (lower strike short) and 7900 (higher strike long). This is similar to what graph 1 and graph 2 suggest.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Again, the point to note here is besides getting the direction right, the strike selection is the key to the profitability of this strategy. One needs to be diligent enough to map the time to expiry to the right strike to make sure that the strategy works in your favor.</p>\n<p>What about the effect of volatility on this strategy? Well, volatility plays a key role here, have a look at the image below –</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-5_volatility.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2938 size-large\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Image-5_volatility.png\" width=\"1024\"/></a></p>\n<p>There are three colored lines depicting the change of “net premium” aka the strategy payoff versus change in volatility. These lines help us understand the effect of increase in volatility on the strategy keeping time to expiry in perspective.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Blue Line</strong> – This line suggests that an increase in volatility when there is ample time to expiry (30 days) is beneficial for the Call ratio back spread. As we can see the strategy payoff increases from -67 to +43 when the volatility increase from 15% to 30%. Clearly this means that when there is ample time to expiry, besides being right on the direction of stock/index you also need to have a view on volatility. For this reason, even though I’m bullish on the stock, I would be a bit hesitant to deploy this strategy at the start of the series if the volatility is on the higher side (say more than double of the usual volatility reading)</li>\n<li><strong>Green line</strong> – This line suggests that an increase in volatility when there are about 15 days time to expiry is beneficial, although not as much as in the previous case. As we can see the strategy payoff increases from -77 to -47 when the volatility increase from 15% to 30%.</li>\n<li><strong>Red line – </strong>This is an interesting, counter intuitive outcome. When there are very few days to expiry, increase in volatility has a negative impact on the strategy! Think about it, increase in volatility when there are few days to expiry enhances the possibility of the option to expiry OTM, hence the premium decreases. So, if you are bullish on a stock / index with few days to expiry, and you also expect the volatility to increase during this period then thread cautiously.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The Call Ratio Backspread is best executed when your outlook on the stock/index is bullish</li>\n<li>The strategy requires you to sell 1 ITM CE and buy 2 OTM CE, and this is to be executed in the same ratio i.e for every 1 sold option, 2 options have to be purchased</li>\n<li>The strategy is usually executed for a ‘net Credit’</li>\n<li>The strategy makes limited money if the stock price goes down, and unlimited profit if the stock price goes up.

The Bear Call Ladder is an improvisation over the Call ratio back spread; this clearly means you implement this strategy when you are out rightly bullish on the stock/index.</p>\n<p>In a Bear Call Ladder, the cost of purchasing call options is financed by selling an ‘in the money’ call option. Further, the Bear Call Ladder is also usually setup for a ‘net credit’, where the cash flow is invariably better than the cash flow of the call ratio back spread. However, do note that both these strategies showcase similar payoff structures but differ slightly in terms of the risk structure.</p>\n<h2>5.2 – Strategy Notes</h2>\n<p>The Bear Call Ladder is a 3 leg option strategy, usually setup for a “net credit”, and it involves –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Selling 1 ITM call option</li>\n<li>Buying 1 ATM call option</li>\n<li>Buying 1 OTM call option</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is the classic Bear Call Ladder setup, executed in a 1:1:1 combination. The bear Call Ladder has to be executed in the 1:1:1 ratio meaning for every 1 ITM Call option sold, 1 ATM and 1 OTM Call option has to be bought. Other combination like 2:2:2 or 3:3:3 (so on and so forth) is possible.</p>\n<p>Let’s take an example – assume Nifty Spot is at 7790 and you expect Nifty to hit 8100 by the end of expiry. This is clearly a bullish outlook on the market. To implement the Bear Call Ladder –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sell 1 ITM Call option</li>\n<li>Buy 1 ATM Call option</li>\n<li>Buy 1 OTM Call option</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Make sure –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Call options belong to the same expiry</li>\n<li>Belongs to the same underlying</li>\n<li>The ratio is maintained</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The trade set up looks like this –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>7600 CE, one lot short, the premium received for this is Rs.247/-</li>\n<li>7800 CE, one lot long, the premium paid for this option is Rs.117/-</li>\n<li>7900 CE, one lot long, the premium paid for this option is Rs.70/-</li>\n<li>The <strong>net credit</strong> would be 247-117-70 = <strong>60</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>With these trades, the bear call ladder is executed. Let us check what would happen to the overall cash flow of the strategies at different levels of expiry.</p>\n<p>Do note we need to evaluate the strategy payoff at various levels of expiry as the strategy payoff is quite versatile.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7600 (below the lower strike price)</strong></p>\n<p>We know the intrinsic value of a call option (upon expiry) is –</p>\n<p>Max [Spot – Strike, 0]</p>\n<p>The 7600 would have an intrinsic value of</p>\n<p>Max [7600 – 7600, 0]</p>\n<p>= 0</p>\n<p>Since we have sold this option, we get to retain the premium received i.e Rs.247/-</p>\n<p>Likewise the intrinsic value of 7800 CE and 7900 CE would also be zero; hence we lose the premium paid i.e Rs.117 and Rs.70 respectively.</p>\n<p>Net cash flow would Premium Received – Premium paid</p>\n<p>= 247 – 117 – 70</p>\n<p>= <strong>60</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7660 (lower strike + net premium received)</strong></p>\n<p>The 7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of –</p>\n<p>Max [Spot – Strike, 0]</p>\n<p>The 7600 would have an intrinsic value of</p>\n<p>Max [7660 – 7600, 0]</p>\n<p>= 60</p>\n<p>Since the 7600 CE is short, we will lose 60 from 247 and retain the balance</p>\n<p>= 247 – 60</p>\n<p>= 187</p>\n<p>The 7800 and 7900 CE would expire worthless, hence we lose the premium paid i.e 117 and 70 respectively.</p>\n<p>The total strategy payoff would be –</p>\n<p>= 187 – 117 – 70</p>\n<p>= 0</p>\n<p>Hence at 7660, the strategy would neither make money nor lose money. Hence this is considered a (lower) breakeven point.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7700 (between the breakeven point and middle strike i.e 7660 and 7800)</strong></p>\n<p>The intrinsic value of 7600 CE would be –</p>\n<p>Max [Spot – Strike, 0]</p>\n<p>= [7700 – 7600, 0]</p>\n<p>= 100</p>\n<p>Since, we have sold this option for 247 the net pay off from the option would be</p>\n<p>247 – 100</p>\n<p>= 147</p>\n<p>On the other hand we have bought 7800 CE and 7900 CE, both of which would expire worthless, hence we lose the premium paid for these options i.e 117 and 70 respectively –</p>\n<p>Net payoff from the strategy would be –</p>\n<p>147 – 117 – 70</p>\n<p>= <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 40</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7800 (at the middle strike price)</strong></p>\n<p>Pay attention here, as this is where the tragedy strikes!</p>\n<p>The 7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 200, considering we have written this option for a premium of Rs.247, we stand to lose the intrinsic value which is Rs.200.</p>\n<p>Hence on the 7600 CE, we lose 200 and retain –</p>\n<p>247 – 200</p>\n<p>= 47/-</p>\n<p>Both 7800 CE and 7900 CE would expire worthless, hence the premium that we paid goes waste, i.e 117 and 70 respectively. Hence our total payoff would be –</p>\n<p>47 – 117 – 70</p>\n<p>= <strong style=\"color: red;\">-140</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 5 – Market expires at 7900 (at the higher strike price)</strong></p>\n<p>Pay attention again, tragedy strikes again ☺</p>\n<p>The 7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 300, considering we have written this option for a premium of Rs.247, we stand to lose all the premium value plus more.</p>\n<p>Hence on the 7600 CE, we lose –</p>\n<p>247 – 300</p>\n<p>= -53</p>\n<p>Both 7800 CE would have an intrinsic value of 100, considering we have paid a premium of Rs.117, the pay off for this option would be –</p>\n<p>100 – 117</p>\n<p>= – 17</p>\n<p>Finally 7900 CE would expire worthless, hence the premium paid i.e 70 would go waste. The final strategy payoff would be –</p>\n<p>-53 – 17 – 70</p>\n<p>= <strong style=\"color: red;\">-140</strong></p>\n<p>Do note, the loss at both 7800 and 7900 is the same.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 6 – Market expires at 8040 (sum of long strike minus short strike minus net premium)</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to the call ratio back spread, the bear call ladder has two breakeven points i.e the upper and lower breakeven. We evaluated the lower breakeven earlier (scenario 2), and this is the upper breakeven point. The upper breakeven is estimated as –</p>\n<p>(7900 + 7800) – 7600 – 60</p>\n<p>= 15700 – 7600 – 60</p>\n<p>= 8100 – 60</p>\n<p>= 8040</p>\n<p>Do note, both 7900 and 7800 are strikes we are long on, and 7600 is the strike we are short on. 60 is the net credit.</p>\n<p>So at 8040, all the call options would have an intrinsic value –</p>\n<p>7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 8040 – 7600 = 440, since we are short on this at 247, we stand to lose 247 – 440 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">-193.</strong></p>\n<p>7800 CE would have an intrinsic value of 8040 – 7800 = 240, since we are long on this at 117, we make 240 – 117 = <strong>+123</strong></p>\n<p>7900 CE would have an intrinsic value of 8040 – 7900 = 140, since we are long on this at 70, we make 140 – 70 = <strong>+70</strong></p>\n<p>Hence the total payoff from the Bear Call Ladder would be –</p>\n<p>-193 + 123 + 70</p>\n<p>= <strong>0</strong></p>\n<p>Hence at 8040, the strategy would neither make money nor lose money. Hence this is considered a (upper) breakeven point.</p>\n<p>Do note, at 7800 and 7900 the strategy was making a loss and at 8040 the strategy broke even. This should give you a sense that beyond 8040, the strategy would make money. Lets just validate this with another scenario.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 7 – Market expires at 8300 </strong></p>\n<p>At 8300 all the call options would have an intrinsic value.</p>\n<p>7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 8300 – 7600 = 700, since we are short on this at 247, we stand to lose 247 – 700 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">-453.</strong></p>\n<p>7800 CE would have an intrinsic value of 8300 – 7800 = 500, since we are long on this at 117, we make 500 – 117 = <strong>+383</strong></p>\n<p>7900 CE would have an intrinsic value of 8300 – 7900 = 400, since we are long on this at 70, we make 400 – 70 = <strong>+330</strong></p>\n<p>Hence the total payoff from the Bear Call Ladder would be –</p>\n<p>-453 + 383 + 330</p>\n<p>= <strong>260</strong></p>\n<p>As you can imagine, the higher the market move, the higher is the profit potential. Here is a table that gives you the payoffs at various levels.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-1_Payoff.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_Payoff\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2968\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"275\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-1_Payoff-1024x352.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-1_Payoff-1024x352.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-1_Payoff-300x103.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-1_Payoff.png 1206w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>Do notice, when the market goes below you stand to make a modest gain of 60 points, but when the market moves up the profits are uncapped.</p>\n<h2>5.3 – Strategy Generalization</h2>\n<p>Going by the above discussed scenarios we can make few generalizations –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spread = technically this is a ladder and not really a spread. However the 1<sup>st</sup> two option legs creates a classic “spread” wherein we sell ITM and buy ATM. Hence the spread could be taken as the difference between the ITM and ITM options. In this case it would be 200 (7800 – 7600)</li>\n<li>Net Credit = Premium Received from ITM CE – Premium paid to ATM &amp; OTM CE</li>\n<li>Max Loss = Spread (difference between the ITM and ITM options) – Net Credit</li>\n<li>Max Loss occurs at = ATM and OTM  Strike</li>\n<li>The payoff when market goes down = Net Credit</li>\n<li>Lower Breakeven = Lower Strike + Net Credit</li>\n<li>Upper Breakeven = Sum of Long strike minus short strike minus net premium</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a graph that highlights all these important points –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-2_graph.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2969\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"385\" sizes=\"(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-2_graph.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-2_graph.png 535w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-2_graph-300x216.png 300w\" width=\"535\"/></a></p>\n<p>Notice how the strategy makes a loss between 7660 and 8040, but ends up making a huge profit if the market moves past 8040. Even if the market goes down you still end up making a modest profit. But you are badly hit if the market does not move at all. Given this characteristics of the Bear Call Ladder, I would suggest you implement the strategy only when you are absolutely sure that the market will move, irrespective of the direction.</p>\n<p>From my experience, I believe this strategy is best executed on stocks (rather than index) when the quarterly results are due.</p>\n<h2>5.4 – Effect of Greeks</h2>\n<p>The effect of Greeks on this strategy is very similar to the effect of Greeks on Call Ratio Back spread, especially the volatility bit. For your easy reference, I’m reproducing the discussion on volatility we had in the previous chapter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-3_volatility.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_volatility\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2970\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"419\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-3_volatility-1024x537.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-3_volatility-1024x537.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-3_volatility-300x157.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-3_volatility.png 1253w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>There are three colored lines depicting the change of “net premium” aka the strategy payoff versus change in volatility. These lines help us understand the effect of increase in volatility on the strategy keeping time to expiry in perspective.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Blue Line</strong> – This line suggests that an increase in volatility when there is ample time to expiry (30 days) is beneficial for the Bear Call Ladder spread. As we can see the strategy payoff increases from -67 to +43 when the volatility increase from 15% to 30%. Clearly this means that when there is ample time to expiry, besides being right on the direction of stock/index you also need to have a view on volatility. For this reason, even though I’m bullish on the stock, I would be a bit hesitant to deploy this strategy at the start of the series if the volatility is on the higher side (say more than double of the usual volatility reading)</li>\n<li><strong>Green line</strong> – This line suggests that an increase in volatility when there are about 15 days time to expiry is beneficial, although not as much as in the previous case. As we can see the strategy payoff increases from -77 to -47 when the volatility increase from 15% to 30%.</li>\n<li><strong>Red line – </strong>This is an interesting, counter intuitive outcome. When there are very few days to expiry, increase in volatility has a negative impact on the strategy! Think about it, increase in volatility when there are few days to expiry enhances the possibility of the option to expiry OTM, hence the premium decreases. So, if you are bullish on a stock / index with few days to expiry, and you also expect the volatility to increase during this period then thread cautiously.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Bear Call Ladder is an improvisation over the Call Ratio Spread</li>\n<li>Invariably the cost of executing a bear call ladder is better than the Call Ratio Spread, but the range above which the market has to move also becomes large</li>\n<li>The Bear Call Ladder is executed by selling 1 ITM CE, buying 1 ATM CE, and 1 OTM CE</li>\n<li>Net Credit = Premium Received from ITM CE – Premium paid to ATM &amp; OTM CE</li>\n<li>Max Loss = Spread (difference between the ITM and ITM options) – Net Credit</li>\n<li>Max Loss occurs at = ATM and OTM  Strike</li>\n<li>The payoff when market goes down = Net Credit</li>\n<li>Lower Breakeven = Lower Strike + Net Credit</li>\n<li>Upper Breakeven = Sum of Long strike minus short strike minus net premium</li>\n<li>Execute the strategy only when you are convinced that the market will move significantly higher.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/C5_Bear-Call-Ladder.xlsx\">Download Bear Call Ladder Excel Sheet</a></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>6.1 – Background</h2>\n<p>Imagine a situation where you would be required to simultaneously establish a long and short position on Nifty Futures, expiring in the same series. How would you do this and more importantly why would you do this?</p>\n<p>We will address both these questions in this chapter. To begin with let us understand how this can be done and later move ahead to understand why one would want to do this (if you are curious, arbitrage is the obvious answer).</p>\n<p>Options as you may have realized by now, are highly versatile derivative instruments; you can use these instruments to create any kind of payoff structure including that of the futures (both long and short futures payoff).</p>\n<p>In this chapter we will understand how we can artificially replicate a long futures pay off using options. However before we proceed, you may want to just review the long Future’s ‘linear’ payoff <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/leverage-payoff/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>here</strong></a></p>\n<p>Alternatively, here is a quick overview –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-1_fut-payoff.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_fut payoff\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3007\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"302\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-1_fut-payoff.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-1_fut-payoff.png 446w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-1_fut-payoff-300x203.png 300w\" width=\"446\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, the long futures position has been initiated at 2360, and at that point you neither make money nor lose money, hence the point at which you initiate the position becomes the breakeven point. You make a profit as the futures move higher than the breakeven point and you make a loss the lower the futures move below the breakeven point. The amount of profit you make for a 10 point up move is exactly the same as the amount of loss you’d make for a 10 point down move. Because of this linearity in payoff, the future is also called a linear instrument.</p>\n<p>The idea with a Synthetic Long is to build a similar long Future’s payoff using options.</p>\n<h2>6.2 – Strategy Notes</h2>\n<p>Executing a Synthetic Long is fairly simple; all that one has to do is –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy the ATM Call Option</li>\n<li>Sell the ATM Put Option</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you do this, you need to make sure –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The options belong to the same underlying</li>\n<li>Belongs to the same expiry</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let us take an example to understand this better. Assume Nifty is at 7389, which would make 7400 the ATM strike. Synthetic Long would require us to go long on 7400 CE, the premium for this is Rs.107 and we would short the 7400 PE at 80.</p>\n<p>The net cash outflow would be the difference between the two premiums i.e 107 – 80 = <strong>27.</strong></p>\n<p>Let us consider a few market expiry scenarios –</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7200 (below ATM)</strong></p>\n<p>At 7200, the 7400 CE would expire worthless, hence we would lose the premium paid i.e Rs.107/-. However the 7400 PE would have an intrinsic value, which can be calculated as follows –</p>\n<p>Intrinsic value of Put Option = Max [Strike-Spot, 0]</p>\n<p>= Max [7400 – 7200, 0]</p>\n<p>=Max [200, 0]</p>\n<p>= 200.</p>\n<p>Clearly, since we are short on this option, we would lose money from the premium we have received. The loss would be –</p>\n<p>80 – 200 = -120</p>\n<p>Total payoff from the long Call and short Put position would be –</p>\n<p>= -107 – 120</p>\n<p>= <strong style=\"color: red;\">-227</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7400 (At ATM)</strong></p>\n<p>If the market expires exactly at 7400, both the options would expire worthless and hence –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We lose the premium paid for the 7400 CE option i.e 107</li>\n<li>We get the retain the premium for the 7400 PE option i.e 80</li>\n<li>Net payoff from both the positions would be <strong>-27</strong>e 80 – 107</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Do note, 27 also happens to be the net cash outflow of the strategy, which is also the difference between the two premiums</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7427 (ATM + Difference between the two premiums)</strong></p>\n<p>7427 is an interesting level, this is the breakeven point for the strategy, where we neither make money nor lose money.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>7400 CE – the option is ITM and has an intrinsic value of 27. However we have paid 107 as premium hence we experience a total loss of 80</li>\n<li>7400 PE – the option would expire OTM, hence we get to retain the entire premium of 80.</li>\n<li>On one hand we make 80 and the other we lose 80. Hence we neither make nor lose any money, making 7427 the <strong>breakeven point</strong> for this strategy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7600 (above ATM)</strong></p>\n<p>At 7600, the 7400 CE would have an intrinsic value of 200, we would make –</p>\n<p>Intrinsic value – Premium</p>\n<p>= 200 – 107</p>\n<p>= 93</p>\n<p>The 7400 PE would expire worthless; hence we get to retain the entire premium of Rs.80.</p>\n<p>Total payoff from the strategy would be –</p>\n<p>= 93 + 80</p>\n<p>= 173</p>\n<p>With the above 4 scenarios, we can conclude that the strategy makes money while the market moves higher and loses money while the market goes lower, similar to futures. However this still does not necessarily mean that the payoff is similar to that of futures. To establish that the synthetic long payoff behaves similar to futures, we need evaluate the payoff of the strategy with reference to the breakeven point; let’s say 200 point above and below the breakeven point. If the payoff is identical, then clearly there is linearity in the payoff, similar to futures.</p>\n<p>So let’s figure this out.</p>\n<p>We know the breakeven point for this is –</p>\n<p><strong>ATM + difference between the premiums</strong></p>\n<p>= 7400 + 27</p>\n<p>= <strong>7427</strong></p>\n<p>The payoff around this point should be symmetric. We will consider <strong>7427 + 200 = 7627</strong> and <strong>7427-200 = 7227</strong> for this.</p>\n<p>At 7627 –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The 7400 CE would have an intrinsic value of 227, hence we get to make 227 – 107 = 120</li>\n<li>The 7400 PE would expire worthless, hence we get to keep the entire premium of 80</li>\n<li>In all we experience a payoff of 120 + 80 = <strong>200</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>At 7227 –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The 7400 CE would not have any intrinsic value, hence we lose the entire premium paid i.e 107</li>\n<li>The 7400 PE would have an intrinsic value of 7400 – 7227 = 173, since we have received 80 as premium the net loss would be 80 – 173 = -93.</li>\n<li>In all we experience a payoff of -93-107 =<strong style=\"color: red;\"> -200</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Clearly, there is payoff symmetry around the breakeven, and for this reason, the <strong>Synthetic Long mimics the payoff of the long futures instrument.</strong></p>\n<p>Further, here is the payoff at various expiry levels –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-2_different-payoff.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_different payoff\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3008\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"335\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-2_different-payoff.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-2_different-payoff.png 910w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-2_different-payoff-300x126.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>And when you plot the Net Payoff, we get the payoff structure which is similar to the long call futures.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-3_payoff.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_payoff\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3009\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"361\" sizes=\"(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-3_payoff.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-3_payoff.png 524w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-3_payoff-300x207.png 300w\" width=\"524\"/></a></p>\n<p>Having figured out how to set up a Synthetic long, we need to figure out the typical circumstances under which setting up a synthetic long is required.</p>\n<h2>6.3 – The Fish market Arbitrage</h2>\n<p>I’ll assume that you have a basic understanding on Arbitrage. In easy words, arbitrage is an opportunity to buy goods/asset in a cheaper market and sell the same in expensive markets and pocket the difference in prices. If executed well, arbitrage trades are almost risk free. Let me attempt to give you a simple example of an arbitrage opportunity.</p>\n<p>Assume you live by a coastal city with abundant supply of fresh sea fish, hence the rate at which fish is sold in your city is very low, let’s say Rs.100 per Kg. The neighboring city which is 125 kms away has a huge demand for the same fresh sea fish. However, in this neighboring city the same fish is sold at Rs.150 per Kg.</p>\n<p>Given this if you can manage to buy the fish from your city at Rs.100 and manage to sell the same in the neighboring city at Rs.150, then in process you clearly get to pocket the price differential i.e Rs.50. Maybe you will have to account for transportation and other logistics, and instead of Rs.50, you get to keep Rs.30/- per Kg. This is still a beautiful deal and this is a typical arbitrage in the fish market!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M6-C7-cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3013\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/M6-C7-cartoon.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/M6-C7-cartoon.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/M6-C7-cartoon-300x200.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>It looks perfect, think about it – if you can do this everyday i.e buy fish from your city at Rs.100 and sell in the neighboring city at Rs.150, adjust Rs.20 towards expenses then Rs.30 per KG is guaranteed risk free profit.</p>\n<p>This is indeed risk free, provides nothing changes. But if things change, so will your profitability, let me list few things that could change –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>No Fish (opportunity risk)</strong> – Assume one day you go to the market to buy fish at Rs.100, and you realize there is no fish in the market. Then you have no opportunity to make Rs.30/-.</li>\n<li><strong>No Buyers (liquidity risk) </strong>– You buy the fish at Rs.100 and go to the neighboring town to sell the same at Rs.150, but you realize that there are no buyers. You are left holding a bag full of dead fish, literally worthless!</li>\n<li><strong>Bad bargaining (execution risk) </strong>– The entire arbitrage opportunity hinges upon the fact that you can ‘always’ bargain to buy at Rs.100 and sell at Rs.150. What if on a bad day you happen to buy at 110 and sell at 140? You still have to pay 20 for transport, this means instead of the regular 30 Rupees profit you get to make only 10 Rupees, and if this continues, then the arbitrage opportunity would become less attractive and you may not want to do this at all.</li>\n<li><strong>Transport becomes expensive (cost of transaction) – </strong>This is another crucial factor for the profitability of the arbitrage trade. Imagine if the cost of transportation increases from Rs.20 to Rs.30? Clearly the arbitrage opportunity starts looking less attractive as the cost of execution goes higher and higher. Cost of transaction is a critical factor that makes or breaks an arbitrage opportunity</li>\n<li><strong>Competition</strong> <strong>kicks in</strong> <strong>(who can drop lower?)</strong> – Given that the world is inherently competitive you are likely to attract some competition who would also like to make that risk free Rs.30. Now imagine this –\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>So far you are the only one doing this trade i.e buy fish at Rs.100 and sell at Rs.150</li>\n<li>Your friend notices you are making a risk free profit, and he now wants to copy you. You can’t really prevent his as this is a free market.</li>\n<li>Both of you buy at Rs.100, transport it at Rs.20, and attempt to sell it in the neighboring town</li>\n<li>A potential buyer walks in, sees there is a new seller, selling the same quality of fish. Who between the two of you is likely to sell the fish to the buyer?</li>\n<li>Clearly given the fish is of the same quality the buyer will buy it from the one selling the fish at a cheaper rate. Assume you want to acquire the client, and therefore drop the price to Rs.145/-</li>\n<li>Next day your friend also drops the price, and offers to sell fish at Rs.140 per KG, and therefore igniting a price war. In the whole process the price keeps dropping and the arbitrage opportunity just evaporates.</li>\n<li>How low can the price drop? Obviously it can drop to Rs.120 (cost of buying fish plus transport). Beyond 120, it does not makes sense to run the business</li>\n<li>Eventually in a perfectly competitive world, competition kicks in and arbitrage opportunity just ceases to exist. In this case, the cost of fish in neighboring town would drop to Rs.120 or a price point in that vicinity.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope the above discussion gave you a quick overview on arbitrage. In fact we can define any arbitrage opportunity in terms of a simple mathematical expression, for example with respect to the fish example, here is the mathematical equation –</p>\n<p><strong>[Cost of selling fish in town B – Cost of buying fish in town A] = 20</strong></p>\n<p>If there is an imbalance in the above equation, then we essentially have an arbitrage opportunity. In all types of markets – fish market, agri market, currency market, and stock market such arbitrage opportunities exist and they are all governed by simple arithmetic equations.</p>\n<h2>6.4 – The Options arbitrage</h2>\n<p>Arbitrage opportunities exist in almost every market, one needs to be a keen observer of the market to spot it and profit from it. Typically stock market based arbitrage opportunities allow you to lock in a certain profit (small but guaranteed) and carry this profit irrespective of which direction the market moves. For this reason arbitrage trades are quite a favorite with risk intolerant traders.</p>\n<p>I would like to discuss a simple arbitrage case here, the roots of which lie in the concept of <strong>‘Put Call Parity’</strong>. I will skip discussing the Put Call Parity theory but would instead jump to illustrate one of its applications.</p>\n<p>However I’d suggest you watch this beautiful video from Khan Academy to understand the Put Call Parity –</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"355\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/embed_video?v=m4mrd7sHCPM\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n<p>So based on Put Call Parity, here is an arbitrage equation –</p>\n<p><strong>Long Synthetic long + Short Futures = 0</strong></p>\n<p>You can elaborate this to –</p>\n<p><strong>Long ATM Call + Short ATM Put + Short Futures = 0</strong></p>\n<p>The equation states that the P&amp;L upon expiry by virtue of holding a long synthetic long and short future should be zero. Why should this position result in a zero P&amp;L, well the answer to this is attributable to the Put Call Parity.</p>\n<p>However, if the P&amp;L is a non zero value, then we have an arbitrage opportunity.</p>\n<p>Here is an example that will help you understand this well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-4_Nifty-Fut.png\"><img alt=\"Image 4_Nifty Fut\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3010\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"517\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-4_Nifty-Fut.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-4_Nifty-Fut.png 570w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-4_Nifty-Fut-300x272.png 300w\" width=\"570\"/></a></p>\n<p>On 21<sup>st</sup> Jan, Nifty spot was at 7304, and the Nifty Futures was trading at 7316.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-5_Syn-Call.png\"><img alt=\"Image 5_Syn Call\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3011\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"364\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-5_Syn-Call.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-5_Syn-Call.png 828w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Image-5_Syn-Call-300x137.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The 7300 CE and PE (ATM options) were trading at 79.5 and 73.85 respectively.

But what’s the catch you may ask?</p>\n<p>Transaction charges!</p>\n<p>One has to account for the cost of execution of this trade and figure out if it still makes sense to take up the trade. Consider this –</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brokerage</strong> – if you are trading with a traditional broker, then you will be charged on a percentage basis which will eat away your profits. So on one hand you make 10 points, but you may end up paying 8 – 10 points as brokerage. However if you were to do this trade with a discount broker like Zerodha, your breakeven on this trade would be around 4-5 points. This should give you more reason to open your account with Zerodha ☺</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>STT</strong> – Do remember the P&amp;L is realised upon expiry; hence you would have to carry forward your positions to expiry. If you are long on an ITM option (which you will be) then upon expiry you will have to pay a hefty STT, which will further eat away your profits. Please do <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/z-connect/queries/stock-and-fo-queries/stt-options-nse-bse-mcx-sx\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>read this</strong></a> to know more.</li>\n<li><strong>Other applicable taxes – </strong>Besides you also have to account for service tax, stamp duty etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So considering these costs, the efforts to carry an arbitrage trade for 10 points may not make sense. But it certainly would, if the payoff was something better, maybe like 15 or 20 points. With 15 or 20 points you can even maneuver the STT trap by squaring off the positions just before expiry – although it will shave off a few points.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>You can use options to replicate futures payoff</li>\n<li>A synthetic long replicates the long futures payoff</li>\n<li>Simultaneously buying ATM call and selling ATM Put creates a synthetic long</li>\n<li>The breakeven point for the synthetic long is the <strong>ATM strike + net premium paid</strong></li>\n<li>An arbitrage opportunity is created when Synthetic long + short futures yields a positive non zero P&amp;L upon expiry</li>\n<li>Execute the arbitrage trade only if the P&amp;L upon expiry makes sense after accounting for expenses.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/C6_Synthetic-Long-Arbitrage1.xlsx\">Download Synthetic Long &amp; Arbitrage Excel Sheet</a></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

These strategies ranged to suit an assortment of market outlook – from an outrightly bullish market outlook to moderately bullish market outlook. Reading through the last 5 chapters you must have realised that most professional options traders prefer initiating a spread strategy versus taking on naked option positions. No doubt, spreads tend to shrink the overall profitability, but at the same time spreads give you a greater visibility on risk. Professional traders value ‘risk visibility’ more than the profits. In simple words, it’s a much better deal to take on smaller profits as long as you know what would be your maximum loss under worst case scenarios.</p>\n<p>Another interesting aspect of spreads is that invariably there is some sort of financing involved, wherein the purchase of an option is funded by the sale of another option. In fact, financing is one of the key aspects that differentiate a spread versus a normal naked directional position. Over the next few chapters we will discuss strategies which you can deploy when your outlook ranges from moderately bearish to out rightly bearish. The composition of these strategies is similar to the bullish strategies that we discussed earlier in the module.</p>\n<p>The first bearish strategy we will look into is the Bear Put Spread, which as you may have guessed is the equivalent of the Bull Call Spread.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/M6-C7-Cartoon1.png\"><img alt=\"M6-C7-Cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3054\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"377\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/M6-C7-Cartoon1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/M6-C7-Cartoon1.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/M6-C7-Cartoon1-300x200.png 300w\" width=\"566\"/></a></p>\n<h2>7.2 – Strategy notes</h2>\n<p>Similar to the Bull Call Spread, the Bear Put Spread is quite easy to implement. One would implement a bear put spread when the market outlook is moderately bearish, i.e you expect the market to go down in the near term while at the same time you don’t expect it to go down much. If I were to quantify ‘moderately bearish’, a 4-5% correction would be apt. By invoking a bear put spread one would make a modest gain if the markets correct (go down) as expected but on the other hand if the markets were to go up, the trader will end up with a limited loss.</p>\n<p>A conservative trader (read as risk averse trader) would implement Bear Put Spread strategy by simultaneously –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buying an In the money Put option</li>\n<li>Selling an Out of the Money Put option</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is no compulsion that the Bear Put Spread has to be created with an ITM and OTM option. The Bear Put spread can be created employing any two put options. The choice of strike depends on the aggressiveness of the trade. However do note that both the options should belong to the same expiry and same underlying. To understand the implementation better, let’s take up an example and see how the strategy behaves under different scenarios.</p>\n<p>As of today Nifty is at 7485, this would make 7600 PE In the money and 7400 PE Out of the money. The ‘Bear Put Spread’ would require one to sell 7400 PE, the premium received from the sale would partially finance the purchase of the 7600 PE. The premium paid (PP) for the 7600 PE is Rs.165, and the premium received (PR) for the 7400 PE is Rs.73/-. The net debit for this transaction would be –</p>\n<p>73 – 165</p>\n<p>= <strong style=\"color: red;\">-92</strong></p>\n<p>To understand how the payoff of the strategy works under different expiry circumstances, we need to consider different scenarios. Please do bear in mind the payoff is upon expiry, which means to say that the trader is expected to hold these positions till expiry.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7800 (above long put option i.e 7600)</strong></p>\n<p>This is a case where the market has gone up as opposed to the expectation that it would go down. At 7800 both the put option i.e 7600 and 7400 would not have any intrinsic value, hence they would expire worthless.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The premium paid for 7600 PE i.e Rs.165 would go to 0, hence we retain nothing</li>\n<li>The premium received for 7400 PE i.e Rs.73 would be retained entirely</li>\n<li>Hence at 7800, we would lose Rs.165 on one hand but this would be partially offset by the premium received i.e Rs.73</li>\n<li>The overall loss would be -165 + 73 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">-92</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do note the ‘-ve’ sign associated with 165 indicates that this is a money outflow from the account, and the ‘+ve’ sign associated with 73 indicates that the money is received into the account.</p>\n<p>Also, the net loss of 92 is equivalent to the net debit of the strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Market expired at 7600 (at long put option)</strong></p>\n<p>In this scenario we assume the market expires at 7600, where we have purchased a Put option. But then, at 7600 both 7600 and 7400 PE would expire worthless (similar to scenario 1) resulting in a loss of <strong style=\"color: red;\">-92.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7508 (breakeven)</strong></p>\n<p>7508 is half way through 7600 and 7400, and as you may have guessed I’ve picked 7508 specifically to showcase that the strategy neither makes money nor loses any money at this specific point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 7600 PE would have an intrinsic value equivalent to Max [7600 -7508, 0], which is 92.</li>\n<li>Since we have paid Rs.165 as premium for the 7600 PE, some of the premium paid would be recovered. That would be 165 – 92 = 73, which means to say the net loss on 7600 PE at this stage would be Rs.73 and not Rs.165</li>\n<li>The 7400 PE would expire worthless, hence we get to retain the entire premium of Rs.73</li>\n<li>So on hand we make 73 (7400 PE) and on the other we lose 73 (7600 PE) resulting in a no loss no profit situation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hence, 7508 would be the breakeven point for this strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7400 (at short put option)</strong></p>\n<p>This is an interesting level, do recall when we initiated the position the spot was at 7485, and now the market has gone down as expected. At this point both the options would have interesting outcomes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 7600 PE would have an intrinsic value equivalent to Max [7600 -7400, 0], which is 200</li>\n<li>We have paid a premium of Rs.165, which would be recovered from the intrinsic value of Rs.200, hence after compensating for the premium paid one would retain Rs.35/-</li>\n<li>The 7400 PE would expire worthless, hence the entire premium of Rs.73 would be retained</li>\n<li>The net profit at this level would be 35+73 = 108</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The net payoff from the strategy is in line with the overall expectation from the strategy i.e the trader gets to make a modest profit when the market goes down.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 5 – Market expires at 7200 (below the short put option)</strong></p>\n<p>This is again an interesting level as both the options would have an intrinsic value. Lets figure out how the numbers add up –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 7600 PE would have an intrinsic value equivalent to Max [7600 -7200, 0], which is 400</li>\n<li>We have paid a premium of Rs.165, which would be recovered from the intrinsic value of Rs.400, hence after compensating for the premium paid one would retain Rs.235/-</li>\n<li>The 7400 PE would have an intrinsic value equivalent to Max [7400 -7200, 0], which is 200</li>\n<li>We received a premium of Rs.73, however we will have to let go of the premium and bear a loss over and above 73. This would be 200 -73 = 127</li>\n<li>On one hand we make a profit of Rs.235 and on the other we lose 127, therefore the net payoff of the strategy would be 235 – 127 = 108.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Summarizing all the scenarios (I’ve put up the payoff values directly after considering the premiums)</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Market Expiry</th>\n<th>Long Put (7600)_IV</th>\n<th>Short Put (7400)_IV</th>\n<th>Net payoff</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7800</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>-92</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7600</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>-92</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7508</td>\n<td>92</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7200</td>\n<td>400</td>\n<td>200</td>\n<td>+108</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Do note, the net payoff from the strategy is in line with the overall expectation from the strategy i.e the trader gets to make a modest profit when the market goes down while at the same time the losses are capped in case the market goes up.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the table below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-1_payoff1.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_payoff\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3052\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"313\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-1_payoff1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-1_payoff1.png 885w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-1_payoff1-300x117.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/><br/>\n</a>The table below shows the strategy payoff at different expiry levels.

Whenever you implement an options strategy always add up the deltas. I used the <strong><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/tools/black-scholes\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;S calculator</a></strong> to calculate the deltas.</p>\n<p>The delta of 7600 PE is -0.618</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-3_delta-1.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_delta 1\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3045\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"267\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-3_delta-1-1024x342.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-3_delta-1-1024x342.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-3_delta-1-300x100.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-3_delta-1.png 1108w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The delta of 7400 PE is – 0.342</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-4_delta-21.png\"><img alt=\"Image 4_delta 2\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3051\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"276\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-4_delta-21-1024x353.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-4_delta-21-1024x353.png 1024w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-4_delta-21-300x103.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-4_delta-21.png 1109w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The negative sign indicates that the put option premium will go down if the markets go up, and premium gains value if the markets go down. But do note, we have written the 7400 PE, hence the Delta would be</p>\n<p>-(-0.342)</p>\n<p>+ 0.342</p>\n<p>Now, since deltas are additive in nature we can add up the deltas to give the combined delta of the position. In this case it would be –</p>\n<p>-0.618 + (+0.342)</p>\n<p><strong>= – 0.276</strong></p>\n<p>This means the strategy has an overall delta of 0.276 and the ‘–ve’ indicates that the premiums will go up if the markets go down. Similarly you can add up the deltas of other strategies we’ve discussed earlier – Bull Call Spread, Call Ratio Back spread etc and you will realize they all have a positive delta indicating that the strategy is bullish.</p>\n<p>When you have more than 2 option legs it gets really difficult to estimate the overall bias of the strategy (whether the strategy is bullish or bearish), in such cases you can quickly add up the deltas to know the bias. Further, if in case the deltas add to zero, then it means that the strategy is not really biased to any direction. Such strategies are called ‘Delta Neutral’. We will eventually discuss these strategies at a later point in this module.</p>\n<p>Also, you may be interested to know that while the delta neutral strategies are immune to market’s directional move, they react to changes in volatility and time, hence these are also sometime called “Volatility based strategies”.</p>\n<h2>7.5 – Strike selection and effect of volatility</h2>\n<p>The strike selection for a bear put spread is very similar to the strike selection methodology of a bull call spread.

The Bear Call Spread is similar to the Bear Put Spread in terms of the payoff structure; however there are a few differences in terms of strategy execution and strike selection. The Bear Call spread involves creating a spread by employing ‘Call options’ rather than ‘Put options’ (as is the case in bear put spread).</p>\n<p>You may have a fundamental question at this stage – when the payoffs from both Bear Put spread and Bear Call spread are similar, why should one choose a Bear Call spread over a Bear Put spread?</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M6-Ch8-Cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3087\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/M6-Ch8-Cartoon1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/M6-Ch8-Cartoon1.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/M6-Ch8-Cartoon1-300x200.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>Well, this really depends on how attractive the premiums are. While the Bear Put spread is executed for a <strong style=\"color: red;\">debit</strong>, the Bear Call spread is executed for a <strong style=\"color: green;\">credit</strong>. So if you are at a point in the market where –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The markets have rallied considerably (therefore CALL premiums have swelled)</li>\n<li>The volatility is favorable</li>\n<li>Ample time to expiry</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And you have a moderately bearish outlook going forward, then it makes sense to invoke a Bear Call Spread for a net credit as opposed to invoking a Bear Put Spread for a net debit. Personally I do prefer strategies which offer net credit rather than strategies which offer net debit.</p>\n<h2>8.2 – Strategy Notes</h2>\n<p>The Bear Call Spread is a two leg spread strategy traditionally involving ITM and OTM Call options. However you can create the spread using other strikes as well. Do remember, the higher the difference between the two selected strikes (spread), larger is the profit potential.</p>\n<p>To implement the bear call spread –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy 1 OTM Call option (leg 1)</li>\n<li>Sell 1 ITM Call option (leg 2)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ensure –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All strikes belong to the same underlying</li>\n<li>Belong to the same expiry series</li>\n<li>Each leg involves the same number of options</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let us take up example to understand this better –</p>\n<p>Date – February 2016</p>\n<p>Outlook – Moderately bearish</p>\n<p>Nifty Spot – 7222</p>\n<p>Bear Call Spread, trade set up –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Buy 7400 CE</strong> by paying Rs.38/- as premium; do note this is an OTM option. Since money is going out of my account this is a debit transaction</li>\n<li><strong>Sell 7100 CE</strong> and receive Rs.136/- as premium, do note this is an ITM option. Since I receive money, this is a credit transaction</li>\n<li>The net cash flow is the difference between the debit and credit i.e 136 – 38 = <strong>+98,</strong> since this is a positive cashflow, there is a net credit to my account.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Generally speaking in a bear call spread there is always a ‘net credit’, hence the bear call spread is also called referred to as a ‘credit spread’. After we initiate the trade, the market can move in any direction and expiry at any level. Therefore let us take up a few scenarios to get a sense of what would happen to the bear put spread for different levels of expiry.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7500 (above the long Call)</strong></p>\n<p>At 7500, both the Call options would have an intrinsic value and hence they both would expire in the money.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7400 CE would have an intrinsic value of 100, since we have paid a premium of Rs.38, we would be in a profit of 100 – 38 = 62</li>\n<li>7100 CE would have an intrinsic value of 400, since we have sold this option at Ra.136, we would incur a loss of 400 – 136 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">-264</strong></li>\n<li>Net loss would be -264 + 62 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 202</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7400 (at the long call)</strong></p>\n<p>At 7400, the 7100 CE would have an intrinsic value and hence would expire in the money. The 7400 CE would expire worthless.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7400 CE would expire worthless, hence the entire premium of Rs.38 would be written of as a loss.</li>\n<li>7100 CE would have an intrinsic value of 300, since we have sold this option at Ra.136, we would incur a loss of 300 – 136 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">-164</strong></li>\n<li>Net loss would be -164 -38 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 202</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do note, the loss at 7400 is similar to the loss at 7500 pointing to the fact that above a certain point loss is capped to 202.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7198 (breakeven)</strong></p>\n<p>At 7198, the trade neither makes money or losses money, hence this is considered a breakeven point. Let us see how the numbers play out here –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At 7198, the 7100CE would expire with an intrinsic value of 98. Since we have sold the option at Rs.136, we get to retain a portion of the premium i.e 136 – 98 = <strong>+38</strong></li>\n<li>7400 CE would expire worthless, hence we will lose the premium paid i.e 38</li>\n<li>Net payoff would -38 + 38 = 0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This clearly indicates that the strategy neither makes money or losses money at 7198.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7100 (at the short call)</strong></p>\n<p>At 7100, both the Call options would expire worthless, hence it would be out of the money.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7400 would not have any value, hence the premium paid would be a complete loss, i.e Rs.38</li>\n<li>7100 will also not have any intrinsic value, hence the entire premium received i.e Rs.136 would be retained back</li>\n<li>Net profit would be 136 – 38 = <strong>98</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clearly, as and when the market falls, the strategy makes a profit.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 5 – Market expires at 7000 (below the short call)</strong></p>\n<p>This scenario tests the profitability of the strategy when the market falls further. At 7000, both the call options would expire worthless. While we treat the premium paid for 7400 CE i.e Rs.38 as a loss , we will retain the entire premium received for 7100 CE i.e Rs.136 as a profit. Hence the net profit from the strategy would be 136-38 = <strong>98. </strong>Clearly, as and when the market falls, the strategy tends to make money, but it is capped to Rs.98.</p>\n<p>Here is the payoff for the strategy at different expiries –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-1_Payoff-edit.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_Payoff-edit\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3089\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"317\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-1_Payoff-edit.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-1_Payoff-edit.png 857w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-1_Payoff-edit-300x119.png 300w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>These payoffs can be plotted to get the graph of the strategy payoff –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-2_graph1.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3082\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"291\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-2_graph1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-2_graph1.png 482w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Image-2_graph1-300x181.png 300w\" width=\"482\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can observe, the payoff is similar to a bear put spread where both the profits under best case scenario and losses under worst case scenario is pre defined.</p>\n<h2>8.3 – Strategy Generalization</h2>\n<p>Going by the above payoff we can generalize the key trigger points for the strategy –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spread = Difference between the strikes\n<ul>\n<li>7400 – 7100 = 300</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Net Credit =  Premium Received – Premium Paid\n<ul>\n<li>136 – 38 = 98</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Breakeven = Lower strike + Net Credit\n<ul>\n<li>7100 + 98 = 7198</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Max Profit = Net Credit</li>\n<li>Max Loss = Spread – Net Credit\n<ul>\n<li>300 – 98 = 202</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this stage, we can add up the Deltas to get the overall position delta to know the strategy’s sensitivity to the directional movement.</p>\n<p>From the BS calculator I got the Delta values as follows –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7400 CE is OTM option and has a delta of +0.32</li>\n<li>7100 CE is ITM option and has a delta of +0.89</li>\n<li>Since we are short 7100 CE, the delta is –(+0.89) = -0.89</li>\n<li>Overall position delta is = +0.32 + (-0.89) = <strong>-0.57</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The delta of the strategy is negative, and it indicates that the strategy makes money when the underlying goes down, and makes a loss when the underlying goes up.</p>\n<h2>8.4 – Strike Selection and impact of Volatility</h2>\n<p>The following images help us identify the best call option strikes to choose, given the time to expiry.

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>9.1 – Background</h2>\n<p>We discussed the “Call Ratio Back spread” strategy extensively in chapter 4 of this module. The Put ratio back spread is similar except that the trader invokes this when he is bearish on the market or stock.</p>\n<p>At a broad level this is what you will experience when you implement the Put Ratio Back Spread</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unlimited profit if the market goes down</li>\n<li>Limited profit if market goes up</li>\n<li>A predefined loss if the market stays within a range</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In simpler words you make money as long as the market moves in either direction, of course the strategy is more favorable if market goes down.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M6-C9-cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3185\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/M6-C9-cartoon-1.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/M6-C9-cartoon-1.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/M6-C9-cartoon-1-300x200.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>Usually, the Put Ratio Back Spread is deployed for a ‘net credit’, meaning money flows into your account as soon as you execute Put Ratio Back Spread. The ‘net credit’ is what you make if the market goes up, as opposed to your expectation (i.e market going down). On the other hand if the market indeed goes down, then you stand to make an unlimited profit.</p>\n<p>I suppose this should also explain why the put ratio back spread is better than buying a plain vanilla put option.</p>\n<h2>9.2 – Strategy Notes</h2>\n<p>The Put Ratio Back Spread is a 3 leg option strategy as it involves <strong>buying two OTM</strong> Put options and <strong>selling one ITM</strong> Put option. This is the classic 2:1 combo. In fact the put ratio back spread has to be executed in the 2:1 ratio meaning 2 options bought for every one option sold, or 3 options bought for every 2 options sold, so on and so forth.</p>\n<p>Let take an example – Nifty Spot is at 7506 and you expect Nifty to hit 7000 by the end of expiry. This is clearly a bearish expectation. To implement the Put Ratio Back Spread –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sell <strong>one</strong> lot of 7500 PE (ITM)</li>\n<li>Buy <strong>two</strong> lots of 7200 PE (OTM)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Make sure –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Put options belong to the same expiry</li>\n<li>Belong to the same underlying</li>\n<li>The ratio is maintained</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The trade set up looks like this –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>7500 PE, one lot short, the premium received for this is Rs.134/-</li>\n<li>7200 PE, two lots long, the premium paid is Rs.46/- per lot, so Rs.92/- for 2 lots</li>\n<li>Net Cash flow is = Premium Received – Premium Paid i.e 134 – 92 = <strong>42</strong> (Net Credit)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With these trades, the Put ratio back spread is executed. Let us check what would happen to the overall cash flow of the strategies at different levels of expiry.</p>\n<p>Do note we need to evaluate the strategy payoff at various levels of expiry, as the strategy payoff is quite versatile.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7600 (above the ITM option)</strong></p>\n<p>At 7600, both the Put options would expire worthless. The intrinsic value of options and the eventual strategy payoff is as below –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7200 PE, would expire worthless, since we are long 2 lots of this option at Rs.46 per lot, we would <strong>lose </strong>the entire premium of Rs.92 paid</li>\n<li>7500 PE would also expire worthless, but we have written this option and received a premium of Rs.134, which in this case can be retained back</li>\n<li>The net payoff from the strategy is 134 – 92 = <strong>42</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do note, the net payoff of the strategy at 7600 (higher than the ITM strike) is equivalent to the net credit.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7500 (at the higher strike i.e the ITM option)</strong></p>\n<p>At 7500 both the options would have no intrinsic value, hence they both would expire worthless. Hence the payoff would be similar to the payoff we discussed at 7600. Hence the net strategy payoff would be equal to Rs.42 (net credit).</p>\n<p>In fact as you may have guessed, the payoff of the strategy at any point above 7500 is equal to the net credit.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7458 (higher break even)</strong></p>\n<p>Like in the call ratio back spread strategy, the put ratio back spread too has two breakeven points i.e the upper breakeven and the lower breakeven point. 7458 marks the upper breakeven level; of course we will discuss how we arrived at the upper breakeven point a little later in the chapter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At 7458, the 7500 PE will have an intrinsic value. As you may recall, the put option intrinsic value can be calculated as Max[Strike – Spot, 0] i.e Max[7500 – 7458, 0] hence 42</li>\n<li>Since we have sold 7500 PE at 134, we will lose a portion of the premium received and retain the rest. Hence the payoff would be 134 – 42 = <strong>92</strong></li>\n<li>The 7200 PE will not have any intrinsic value, hence the entire premium paid i.e 92 is lost</li>\n<li>So on one hand we made 92 on the 7500 PE and on the other we would lose 92 on the 7200 PE resulting in no loss, no gain. Thus, 7458 marks as one of the breakeven points.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7200 (Point of maximum pain)</strong></p>\n<p>This is the point at which the strategy causes maximum pain, let us figure out why.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At 7200, 7500 PE would have an intrinsic value of 300 (7500 – 7200). Since we have sold this option and received a premium of Rs.134, we would lose the entire premium received and more. The payoff on this would be 134 – 300 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 166</strong></li>\n<li>7200 PE would expire worthless as it has no intrinsic value. Hence the entire premium paid of Rs.92 would be lost</li>\n<li>The net strategy payoff would be -166 – 92 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 258</strong></li>\n<li>This is a point where both the options would turn against us, hence is considered as the point of maximum pain</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scenario 5 – Market expires at 6942 (lower break even)</strong></p>\n<p>At 6942, both the options would have an intrinsic value; however this is the lower breakeven point. Let’s figure out how this works –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At 6942, 7500 PE will have an intrinsic value equivalent of 7500 – 6942 = 558. Since have sold this option at 134, the payoff would be 134 – 558 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 424</strong></li>\n<li>The 7200 PE will also have an intrinsic value equivalent of 7200 – 6942 = 258 per lot, since we are long two lots the intrinsic value adds upto 516. We have initially paid a premium of Rs.92 (both lots included), hence this needs to be deducted to arrive at the payoff would be 516 – 92 = +424</li>\n<li>So on one hand we make 424 on the 7200 PE and on the other we would lose 424 on the 7500 PE resulting in no loss, no gain. Thus, 6942 marks as one of the breakeven points.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scenario 6 – Market expires at 6800 (below the lower strike price)</strong></p>\n<p>Remember, the put ratio backspread is a bearish strategy. It is supposed to make money once the market goes below the lower breakeven point. So lets understand how the pay off behaves at a point lower than the lower breakeven point.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At 6800, 7500 PE will have an intrinsic value of 700 and since we are short 7500PE at 134, we would lose 134 -700 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 566</strong></li>\n<li>7200 PE will have an intrinsic value of 400. Since we are long 2 lots, the intrinsic value would be 800. Premium paid for two lots is Rs.92, hence after adjusting for the premium paid, we get to make 800 – 92 = +708</li>\n<li>Net strategy payoff would be 708 – 566 = +142</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Likewise, you can evaluate the strategy payoff at different levels of market expiry and you will realize that the profits are uncapped as long as the market continues to slide.

In other words this is a directional strategy (profitable when markets go down) and therefore the delta at overall strategy level should reflect this. Let us do the math to figure this out –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7500 PE is ITM option, delta is – 0.55. However since we have written the option, the delta is –(-0.55) = +0.55</li>\n<li>7200 PE is OTM, has a delta of – 0.29, remember we are long two lots here</li>\n<li>The overall position delta would be +0.55 + (-0.29) +(-0.29) = <strong>– 0.03</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The non zero Delta value clearly indicates that the strategy is sensitive to the directional movement (although negligible). The negative sign indicates that the strategy makes money when the market goes down.</p>\n<p>As far as the strikes are concerned, I’d suggest you stick to the classic combination of ITM and OTM options. Remember the trade needs to be executed for a ‘Net Credit’. Do not initiate this strategy if there is a net outflow of cash at the time of execution.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the variation in volatility and its effect on the strategy –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-5_volatility2.png\"><img alt=\"Image 5_volatility\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3180\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"369\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-5_volatility2.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-5_volatility2.png 1300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-5_volatility2-300x138.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-5_volatility2-1024x473.png 1024w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>There are three colored lines depicting the change of “premium value” versus change in volatility. These lines help us understand the effect of increase in volatility on the strategy keeping time to expiry in perspective.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Blue Line</strong> – This line suggests that an increase in volatility when there is ample time to expiry (30 days) is beneficial for the Put ratio back spread. As we can see the strategy payoff increases from -57 to +10 when the volatility increase from 15% to 30%. Clearly this means that when there is ample time to expiry, besides being right on the direction of stock/index you also need to have a view on volatility. For this reason, even though I’m bearish on the stock, I would be a bit hesitant to deploy this strategy at the start of the series if the volatility is on the higher side (say more than double of the usual volatility reading)</li>\n<li><strong>Green line</strong> – This line suggests that an increase in volatility when there are about 15 days time to expiry is beneficial, although not as much as in the previous case. As we can see the strategy payoff increases from -77 to -47 when the volatility increase from 15% to 30%.</li>\n<li><strong>Red line </strong>– Clearly increase in volatility when we have a few days to expiry does not have much impact on the premium value. This means, when you are close to expiry you only need to worry about the directional movement and need not really worry much about the variation in volatility.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The Put Ratio Back spread is best executed when your outlook on the stock/index is bearish</li>\n<li>The strategy requires you to sell 1 ITM PE and buy 2 OTM PE, and this is to be executed in the same ratio i.e for every 1 option sold, 2 options have to be purchased</li>\n<li>The strategy is usually executed for a ‘Net Credit’</li>\n<li>The strategy makes limited money if the stock price goes up, and unlimited profit when the stock price goes down</li>\n<li>There are two break even points – lower breakeven and upper breakeven</li>\n<li>Spread = Higher Strike – Lower Strike</li>\n<li>Net Credit = Premium Received for Higher strike – 2*Premium paid for lower strike</li>\n<li>Max Loss = Spread – Net Credit</li>\n<li>Max Loss occurs at = Lower Strike</li>\n<li>The payoff when market goes up = Net Credit</li>\n<li>Lower Breakeven = Lower Strike – Max Loss</li>\n<li>Upper Breakeven = Lower Strike + Max Loss</li>\n<li>Irrespective of the time to expiry opt for ITM and OTM strike combination</li>\n<li>Increase in volatility is good for this strategy when there is more time to expiry</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/C9_Put-Ratio-Back-Spread.xlsx\">Download Put Ratio Back Spread Excel Sheet</a></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

All your strategy, planning, efforts, and capital go for a toss. I’m certain this is one situation all of us have been in. In fact this is one of the reasons why most professional traders go beyond the regular directional bets and set up strategies which are insulated against the unpredictable market direction.</p>\n<p>Strategies whose profitability does not really depend on the market direction are called “Market Neutral” or “Delta Neutral” strategies. Over the next few chapters we will understand some of the market neutral strategies and how a regular retail trader can execute such strategies. Let us begin with a ‘Long Straddle’. <img alt=\"M6-C10-Cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3206\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/M6-C10-Cartoon.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/M6-C10-Cartoon.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/M6-C10-Cartoon-300x200.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>10.2 – Long Straddle</h2>\n<p>Long straddle is perhaps the simplest market neutral strategy to implement. Once implemented, the P&amp;L is not affected by the direction in which the market moves. The market can move in any direction, but it has to move. As long as the market moves (irrespective of its direction), a positive P&amp;L is generated. To implement a long straddle all one has to do is –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy a Call option</li>\n<li>Buy a Put option</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ensure –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Both the options belong to the same underlying</li>\n<li>Both the options belong to the same expiry</li>\n<li>Belong to the same strike</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here is an example which explains the execution of a long straddle and the eventual strategy payoff. As I write this, the market is trading at 7579, which would make the strike 7600 ‘At the money’. Long straddle would require us to simultaneously purchase the ATM call and put options. <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-1_Setup.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3202\"><img alt=\"Image 1_Setup\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3202\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"437\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-1_Setup.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-1_Setup.png 1001w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-1_Setup-300x164.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-1_Setup-768x420.png 768w\" width=\"800\"/></a> As you can see from the snapshot above, 7600CE is trading at 77 and 7600 PE is trading at 88. The simultaneous purchase of both these options would result in a net debit of Rs.165. The idea here is – the trader is long on both the call and put options belonging to the ATM strike. Hence the trader is not really worried about which direction the market would move.</p>\n<p>If the market goes up, the trader would expect to see gains in Call options far higher than the loss made (read premium paid) on the put option. Similarly, if the market goes down, the gains in the Put option far exceeds the loss on the call option. Hence irrespective of the direction, the gain in one option is good enough to offset the loss in the other and still yield a positive P&amp;L.  Hence the market direction here is meaningless. Let us break this down further and evaluate different expiry scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7200, put option makes money</strong> This is a scenario where the gain in the put option not only offsets the loss made in the call option but also yields a positive P&amp;L over and above. At 7200 –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7600 CE will expire worthless, hence we lose the premium paid i.e <strong style=\"color: red;\">Rs. 77</strong></li>\n<li>7600 PE will have an intrinsic value of 400. After adjusting for the premium paid i.e Rs.88, we get to retain 400 – 88 = 312</li>\n<li>The net payoff would be 312 – 77 = <strong>+</strong> <strong>235</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, the gain in put option after adjusting for the premium paid for put option and after adjusting for the premium paid for the call option still yields a positive P&amp;L.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7435 (lower breakeven)</strong> This is a situation where the strategy neither makes money nor loses any money.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7600 CE would expire worthless; hence the premium paid has to be written off. Loss would be Rs.77</li>\n<li>7600 PE would have an intrinsic value of 165, hence this is the gain in the put option</li>\n<li>However the net premium paid for the call and put option is Rs.165, which gets adjusted with the gain in the put option</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think about it, with respect to the ATM strike, market has indeed expired at a lesser value. So therefore the put option makes money. However, the gains made in the put option adjusts itself against the premium paid for both the call and put option, eventually leaving no money on the table.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7600 (at the ATM strike)</strong> At 7600, the situation is quite straight forward as both the call and put option would expire worthless and hence the premium paid would be gone. The loss here would be equivalent to the net premium paid i.e Rs.165.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7765 (upper breakeven)</strong> This is similar to the 2<sup>nd</sup> scenario we discussed. This is a point at which the strategy breaks even at a point higher than the ATM strike.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 165, hence this is the gain in Call option</li>\n<li>7600 PE would expire worthless, hence the premium paid towards the option is lost</li>\n<li>The gain made in the 7600 CE is offset against the combined premium paid</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hence the strategy would breakeven at this point.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 5 – Market expires at 8000, call option makes money</strong> Clearly the market in this scenario is way above the 7600 ATM mark. The call option premiums would swell, so much so that the gains in call option will more than offset the premiums paid. Let us check the numbers –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7600 PE will expire worthless, hence the premium paid i.e Rs.88 is to be written off</li>\n<li>At 8000, the 7600 CE will have an intrinsic value of 400</li>\n<li>The net payoff here is 400 – 88 – 77 = <strong>+235</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So as you can see, the gain in call option is significant enough to offset the combined premiums paid. Here is the payoff table at different market expiry levels. <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-2_payofftable.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3203\"><img alt=\"Image 2_payofftable\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3203\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"408\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-2_payofftable.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-2_payofftable.png 944w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-2_payofftable-300x153.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-2_payofftable-768x391.png 768w\" width=\"800\"/></a> As you can observe –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The maximum loss (165) occurs at 7600, which is the ATM strike</li>\n<li>The profits are unlimited in either direction of the market</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can visualize these points in the payoff structure here – <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-3_Payoff.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3204\"><img alt=\"Image 3_Payoff\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3204\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"356\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-3_Payoff.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-3_Payoff.png 576w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-3_Payoff-300x185.png 300w\" width=\"576\"/></a> From the V shaped payoff graph, the following things are quite clear –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>With reference to the ATM strike, the strategy makes money in either direction</li>\n<li>Maximum loss is experienced when markets don’t move and stay at ATM\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Max loss = Net premium paid</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>There are two breakevens – on either side, equidistant from ATM\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Upper Breakeven = ATM + Net premium</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">Lower Breakeven = ATM – Net premium</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’m certain, you find this strategy quite straight forward to understand and implement. In summary, you buy calls and puts, each leg has a limited down side, hence the combined position also has a limited downside and an unlimited profit potential. So in essence, a long straddle is like placing a bet on the price action each-way  – you make money if the market goes up or down. Hence the direction does not matter here. But let me ask you this – if the direction does not matter, what else matters for this strategy?</p>\n<h2>10.3 – Volatility Matters</h2>\n<p>Yes, volatility matters quite a bit when you implement the straddle. I would not be exaggerating if I said that volatility makes or breaks the straddle. Hence a fair assessment on volatility serves as the backbone for the straddle’s success. Have a look at this graph below – <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-4_volatility.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3205\"><img alt=\"Image 4_volatility\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3205\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"370\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-4_volatility.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-4_volatility.png 866w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-4_volatility-300x139.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Image-4_volatility-768x355.png 768w\" width=\"800\"/></a> The y-axis represents the cost of the strategy, which is simply the combined premium of both the options and the x-axis represents volatility. The blue, green, and red line represents how the premium increases when the volatility increases given that there is 30, 15, and 5 days to expiry respectively. As you can see, this is a linear graph and irrespective of time to expiry, the strategy cost increases as and when the volatility increases. Likewise the strategy costs decreases when the volatility decreases.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the blue line; it suggests when volatility is 15%, the cost of setting up a long straddle is 160. Remember the cost of a long straddle represents the combined premium required to buy both call and put options. So at 15% volatility it costs Rs.160 to set up the long straddle, however keeping all else equal, when volatility increases to 30% it costs Rs.340 to set up the same long straddle. In other words, you are likely to double your money in the straddle provided –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You set up the long straddle at the start of the month</li>\n<li>The volatility at the time of setting up the long straddle is relatively low</li>\n<li>After you set up the long straddle, the volatility doubles</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can make similar observations with the green and red line which represents the ‘price to volatility’ behavior when the time to expiry is 15 and 5 days respectively. Now, this also means you will lose money if you execute the straddle when the volatility is high which starts to decline after you execute the long straddle. <strong>This is an extremely crucial point to remember.</strong> At this point, let us have a quick discussion on the overall strategy’s delta. Since we are long on ATM strike, the delta of both the options is close to 0.5.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The call option has a delta of + 0.5</li>\n<li>The put option has a delta of – 0.5</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The delta of call option offsets the delta of put option thereby resulting in a net ‘0’ overall delta. Recall, delta shows the direction bias of the position. A +ve delta indicates a bullish bias and a -ve delta indicates a bearish bias. Given this, a 0 delta indicates that there is no bias whatsoever to the direction of the market. So all strategies which have zero deltas are called ‘Delta Neutral’ and Delta Neutral strategies are insulated against the market direction.</p>\n<h2>10.4 – What can go wrong with the straddle?</h2>\n<p>On the face of it a long straddle looks great. Think about it – you get to make money whichever way the market decides to move. All you need is the right volatility estimate. Therefore, what can really go wrong with a straddle? Well, two things come in between you and the profitability of a long straddle –</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Theta Decay</strong> – All else equal, options are depreciating assets and this particularly hurts long positions. The closer you get to expiration, the lesser time value of the option. Time decay accelerates exponentially during the last week before expiration, so you do not want to hold onto out-of-the-money or at-the-money options into the last week and lose premiums rapidly.</li>\n<li><strong>Large breakevens </strong>– Recollect, in the example we discussed earlier, the breakeven points were 165 points away from the ATM strike. The lower breakeven point was 7435 and the upper breakeven was 7765, considering the ATM strike was 7600. In percentage terms, the market has to move 2.2% (either ways) to achieve breakeven.This means that from the time you initiate the straddle, the market or the stock has to move atleast 2.2% either ways for you to start making money…and this move has to happen within a maximum of 30 days. Further if you want to make a profit of atleast 1% on this trade, then we are talking about a 1% move over and above 2.2% on the index. Such large move on the index is quite a challenge in my opinion and I will explain why in the next chapter.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keeping the above two points plus the impact on volatility in perspective, we can summarize what really needs to work in your favor for the straddle to be profitable –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The volatility should be relatively low at the time of strategy execution</li>\n<li>The volatility should increase during the holding period of the strategy</li>\n<li>The market should make a large move – the direction of the move does not matter</li>\n<li>The expected large move is time bound, should happen quickly – well within the expiry</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From my experience trading long straddles, they are profitable when setup around major market events and the impact of such events should exceed over and above what the market expects. Let me explain the ‘event and expectation’ part a bit more, please do read the following carefully. Let us take the Infosys results as an example here.</p>\n<p><strong>Event</strong> – Quarterly results of Infosys</p>\n<p><strong>Expectation</strong> – ‘Muted to flat’ revenue guideline for the coming few quarters.</p>\n<p><strong>Actual Outcome</strong> – As expected Infosys announces ‘muted to flat’ revenue guideline for the coming few quarters. If you were the set up a long straddle in the backdrop of such an event (and its expectation), and eventually the expectation is matched, then chances are that the straddle would fall apart. This is because around major events, volatility tends to increase which tends to drive the premium high.</p>\n<p>So if you are to buy ATM call and put options just around the corner of an event, then you are essentially buying options when the volatility is high. When events are announced and the outcome is known, the volatility drops like a ball, and therefore the premiums. This naturally breaks the straddle down and the trader would lose money owing to the ‘bought at high volatility and sold at low volatility’ phenomena. I’ve noticed this happening over and over again, and unfortunately have seen many traders lose money exactly for this reason.</p>\n<p><strong>Favorable Outcome</strong> – However imagine, instead of ‘muted to flat’ guideline they announce an ‘aggressive’ guideline. This would essentially take the market by surprise and drive premiums much higher, resulting in a profitable straddle trade. This means there is another angle to straddles – your assessment of the event’s outcome should be couple of notches better than the general market’s assessment.</p>\n<p>You cannot setup a straddle with a mediocre assessment of events and its outcome. This may seem like a difficult proposition but you will have to trust me here – few quality years of trading experience will actually get you to assess situations way better than the rest of the market. So, just for clarity, I’d like to repost all the angles which need to be aligned for the straddle to be profitable –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The volatility should be relatively low at the time of strategy execution</li>\n<li>The volatility should increase during the holding period of the strategy</li>\n<li>The market should make a large move – the direction of the move does not matter</li>\n<li>The expected large move is time bound, should happen quickly – well within the expiry</li>\n<li>Long straddles are to be set around major events, and the outcome of these events to be drastically different from the general market expectation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may be wondering there are far too many points that come in between you and the long straddle’s profitability. But worry not, I’ll share an antidote in the next chapter  – The Short Straddle, and why it makes sense.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Strategies which are insulated to market direction are called ‘Market Neutral’ or ‘Delta neutral’</li>\n<li>Market neutral strategies such as long straddle makes money either which way the market moves</li>\n<li>Long straddle requires you to simultaneously buy the ATM Call and Put option.

Considering the 5 points list, getting the long straddle to work in you favor is quite a challenge.  Do recall, in the previous chapter the breakdown was at 2%, add to this another 1% as desired profits and we are essentially looking for, at least a 3% move on the index. From my experience expecting the market to make such moves regularly is quite a challenge. In fact for this reason alone, I think twice each and every time I need to initiate a long straddle.</p>\n<p>I have witnessed many traders recklessly set up long straddles thinking they are insulated to the market’s directional movement. But in reality they end up losing money in a long straddle – time delay and the general movement in the market (or the lack of it) works against them. Please note, I’m not trying to discourage you from employing the long straddle, no one denies the simplicity and elegance of a long straddle. It works extremely well when all the 5 points above are aligned. My only issue with long straddle is the probability of these 5 points aligning with each other.</p>\n<p>Now think about this – there are quite a few factors which prevents the long straddle to be profitable. So as an extension of this – the same set of factors <strong>‘should’ </strong>favor the opposite of a long straddle, i.e the ‘Short Straddle’.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M6-Ch11-cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3229\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/M6-Ch11-cartoon.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/M6-Ch11-cartoon.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/M6-Ch11-cartoon-300x200.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>11.2 – The Short Straddle</h2>\n<p>Although many traders fear the short straddle (as losses are uncapped), I personally prefer trading the short straddle on certain occasions over its peer strategies. Anyway let us quickly understand the set up of a short straddle, and how its P&amp;L behaves across various scenarios.</p>\n<p>Setting up a short straddle is quite straight forward – as opposed to buying the ATM Call and Put options (like in long straddle) you just have to sell the ATM Call and Put option. Obviously the short strategy is set up for a net credit, as when you sell the ATM options, you receive the premium in your account.</p>\n<p>Here is an example, consider Nifty is at 7589, so this would make the 7600 strike ATM. The option premiums are as follows –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7600 CE is trading at 77</li>\n<li>7600 PE is trading at 88</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the short straddle will require us to sell both these options and collect the net premium of 77 + 88 = 165.</p>\n<p>Please do note – the options should belong to the same underlying, same expiry, and of course same strike. So assuming you have executed this short straddle, let’s figure out the P&amp;L at various market expiry scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7200 (we lose money on put option)</strong></p>\n<p>This is a scenario where the loss in the put option is so large that it eats away the premium collected by both the CE and PE, resulting in an overall loss. At 7200 –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7600 CE will expire worthless, hence we get the retain the premium received i.e <strong>77</strong></li>\n<li>7600 PE will have an intrinsic value of 400. After adjusting for the premium received i.e Rs.88, we lose 400 – 88 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 312</strong></li>\n<li>The net loss would be 312 – 77 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">– 235</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, the gain in call option is offset by the loss in the put option.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7435 (lower breakdown)</strong></p>\n<p>This is a situation where the strategy neither makes money nor loses any money.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7600 CE would expire worthless; hence the premium received is retained. Profit here is Rs.77</li>\n<li>7600 PE would have an intrinsic value of 165, out of which we have received Rs.88 as premium, hence our loss would be 165 – 88 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">-77</strong></li>\n<li>The gain in the call option is completely offset by the loss in the put option. Hence we neither make money nor lose money at 7435.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7600 (at the ATM strike, maximum profit)</strong></p>\n<p>This is the most favorable outcome for a short straddle. At 7600, the situation is quite straight forward as both the call and put option would expire worthless and hence the premium received from both the call and put option will be retained. The gain here would be equivalent to the net premium received i.e Rs.165.</p>\n<p>So this means, in a short straddle you make maximum money when the markets don’t move!</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7765 (upper breakdown)</strong></p>\n<p>This is similar to the 2<sup>nd</sup> scenario we discussed. This is a point at which the strategy breaks even at a point higher than the ATM strike.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7600 CE would have an intrinsic value of 165, hence after adjusting for the premium received of Rs. 77, we stand to lose Rs.88 (165 – 77)</li>\n<li>7600 PE would expire worthless, hence the premium received i.e Rs.88 is retained</li>\n<li>The gain made in the 7600 PE is offset against the loss on the 7600 CE, hence we neither make money nor lose money.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clearly this is the upper breakdown point.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 5 – Market expires at 8000 (we lose money on call option)</strong></p>\n<p>Clearly the market in this scenario is way above the 7600 ATM mark. The call option premium would swell, so would the loss –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7600 PE will expire worthless, hence the premium received i.e Rs.88 is retained</li>\n<li>At 8000, the 7600 CE will have an intrinsic value of 400, hence after adjusting for the premium received of Rs. 77, we stand to lose Rs. 323( 400 -77)</li>\n<li>We have received Rs.88 as premium for the Put option, therefore the loss would be 88- 323 = <strong style=\"color: red;\">-235</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So as you can see, the loss in the call option is significant enough to offset the combined premiums received.</p>\n<p>Here is the payoff table at different market expiry levels.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-1_payoff.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3227\"><img alt=\"Image 1_payoff\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3227\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"386\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-1_payoff.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-1_payoff.png 933w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-1_payoff-300x145.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-1_payoff-768x370.png 768w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can observe –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The maximum profit 165 occurs at 7600, which is the ATM strike</li>\n<li>The strategy remains profitable only between the lower and higher breakdown numbers</li>\n<li>The losses are unlimited in either direction of the market</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We can visualize these points in the payoff structure here –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-2_payoff-chart.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3228\"><img alt=\"Image 2_payoff chart\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3228\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"593\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-2_payoff-chart.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-2_payoff-chart.png 812w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-2_payoff-chart-300x222.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-2_payoff-chart-768x569.png 768w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>From the inverted V shaped payoff graph, the following things are quite clear –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The point at which you can experience maximum profits is at ATM, the profits shrink as you move away from the ATM mark</li>\n<li>The strategy is profitable as long as the market stays within the breakdown points</li>\n<li>Maximum loss is experienced when markets move further away from the breakdown point.

Short straddle works best when markets are expected to be in a range and not really expected to make a large move.</p>\n<p>Many traders fear short straddle considering the fact that short straddles have unlimited losses on either side. However from my experience, short straddles work really well if you know how exactly to deploy this. In fact in the last chapter of the previous module, I had posted a case study involving short straddle. Probably that was one of the best examples of when to implement the short straddle.</p>\n<p>I will repost the same again here and I hope you will be able to appreciate the case study better.</p>\n<h2>11.3 – Case Study (repost from previous module)</h2>\n<p>The following case study was a part of <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/case-studies-wrapping-it-all-up/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Module 5, Chapter 23</strong>.</a> I’m reposting the same here as I assume you would appreciate the example better at this stage. To get the complete context, I’d request you to read the chapter.</p>\n<p>Infosys was expected to announce their Q2 results on 12<sup>th</sup> October. The idea was simple – news drives volatility up, so short options with an expectation that you can buy it back when the volatility cools off. The trade was well planned and the position was initiated on 8<sup>th</sup> Oct – 4 days prior to the event.</p>\n<p>Infosys was trading close to Rs.1142/- per share, so he decided to go ahead with the 1140 strike (ATM).</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot at the time of initiating the trade –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-3.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3233\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"504\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-3.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-3.png 925w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-3-300x189.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-3-768x484.png 768w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>On 8<sup>th</sup> October around 10:35 AM the 1140 CE was trading at 48/- and the implied volatility was at 40.26%. The 1140 PE was trading at 47/- and the implied volatility was at 48%. The combined premium received was 95 per lot.</p>\n<p>Market’s expectation was that Infosys would announce fairly decent set of numbers. In fact the numbers were better than expected, here are the details –</p>\n<p>“For the July-September quarter, Infosys posted a net profit of $519 million, compared with $511 million in the year-ago period. Revenue jumped 8.7 % to $2.39 billion. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 6%, comfortably eclipsing market expectations of 4- 4.5% growth.</p>\n<p>In rupee terms, net profit rose 9.8% to Rs.3398 crore on revenue of Rs. 15,635 crore, which was up 17.2% from last year”.<em> Source: Economic Times.</em></p>\n<p>The announcement came in around 9:18 AM, 3 minutes after the market opened, and this trader did manage to close the trade around the same time.</p>\n<p>Here is the snapshot –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-4.png\"><img alt=\"Image 4\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3234\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"480\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-4.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-4.png 914w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-4-300x180.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-4-768x460.png 768w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>The 1140 CE was trading at 55/- and the implied volatility had dropped to 28%.

The combined premium was 75 per lot, and he made a 20 point profit per lot. </strong></p>\n<h2>11.4 – The Greeks</h2>\n<p>Since we are dealing with ATM options, the delta of both CE and PE would be around 0.5. We could add the deltas of each option and get a sense of how the overall position deltas behave.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7600 CE Delta @ 0.5, since we are short, the delta would be -0.5</li>\n<li>7600 PE Delta @ – 0.5, since we are short, the delta would be + 0.5</li>\n<li>Combined delta would be -0.5 + 0.5 = 0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The combined delta indicates that the strategy is directional neutral. Remember both long and short straddle is delta neutral. In case of long straddle, delta neutral suggests that the profits are uncapped and in case of short straddle, the losses are uncapped.</p>\n<p>Now here is something for you to think about – When you initiate a straddle you are obviously delta neutral. But as the markets move, will your position still remain delta neutral? If yes, why do you think so? If no, then is there a way to keep the position delta neutral?</p>\n<p>If you can build your thoughts around these points, then I can guarantee you that your options knowledge is far greater than 90% of the market participants. To answer these simple questions, you will need to step a little deeper and get into 2<sup>nd</sup> level of thinking.</p>\n<p>Do post your comments below.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Key takeaways from this chapter</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Short straddle requires you to simultaneously Sell the ATM Call and Put option.

    "htmlContent": "<div class=\"post\">\n<h2>12.1 – Background</h2>\n<p>If you have understood the straddle, then understanding the ‘Strangle’ is quite straightforward. For all practical purposes, the thought process behind the straddle and strangle is quite similar. Strangle is an improvisation over the straddle, mainly to reduce the cost of implementation. Let me explain this further.</p>\n<p>Consider this – Nifty is trading at 5921, which would make 5900 the ATM strike. If you were to set up the long straddle here, you would be required to buy the 5900 CE and 5900 PE. The premiums for both these options are 66 and 57 respectively.</p>\n<p>Net cash outlay = 66 + 57 = 123</p>\n<p>Upper breakeven = 5921+123 = 6044</p>\n<p>Lower breakeven = 5921 – 123 = 5798</p>\n<p>Therefore to set up a straddle, you spend 123 and the breakeven on either side is 2.07% away.  As you know the straddle is delta neutral, meaning the strategy is insulated to the directional movement of the market. The idea here is that you know that the market will move to a large extent, but the direction is unknown.</p>\n<p>Consider this – from your research you know that the market will move (direction unknown) hence you have set up the straddle. However the straddle requires you to make an upfront payment of 123.</p>\n<p>How would it be if you were to set up a market neutral strategy – similar to the straddle, but at a much lower cost?</p>\n<p>Well, the ‘Strangle’ does just that.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M6-C12-cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3259\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/M6-C12-cartoon.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/M6-C12-cartoon.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/M6-C12-cartoon-300x200.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<h2>12.2 – Strategy Notes</h2>\n<p>The strangle is an improvisation over the straddle. The improvisation mainly helps in terms of reduction of the strategy cost, however as a tradeoff the points required to breakeven increases.</p>\n<p>In a straddle you are required to buy call and put options of the ATM strike. However the strangle requires you to buy OTM call and put options. Remember when compared to the ATM strike, the OTM will always trade cheap, therefore this implies setting up a strangle is cheaper than setting up a straddle.</p>\n<p>Let’s take an example to explain this better –</p>\n<p>Nifty is trading at 7921, to set up a strangle we need to buy OTM Call and Put options. Do note, both the options should belong to the same expiry and same underlying. Also the execution should happen in the same ratio (missed this point while discussing straddle).</p>\n<p>Same ratio here means – one should buy the same number of call option as that of put option. For instance it can be 1:1 ratio meaning 1 lot of call, 1 lot of put option. Or it can be 5:5, meaning buy 5 lots of call and 5 lots of put option. Something like 2:3 is not considered strangle (or straddle) as in this case you would be buying 2 lots of call options and 3 lots of put options.</p>\n<p>Going back to the example, considering Nifty is at 7921, we need to buy OTM Call and Put options. I’d prefer to buy strikes which are 200 points either way (note, there is no particular reason for choosing strikes 200 points away). So this would mean I would buy 7700 Put option and 8100 Call option. These options are trading at 28 and 32 respectively.</p>\n<p>The combined premium paid to execute the ‘strangle’ is 60. Let’s figure out how the strategies behave under various scenarios. I’ll keep this discussion brief as I do believe you are now comfortable accessing the P&amp;L across various market scenarios.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Market expires at 7500 (much below the PE strike)</strong></p>\n<p>At 7500, the premium paid for the call option i.e. 32 will go worthless. However the put option will have an intrinsic value of 200 points. The premium paid for the Put option is 28, hence the total profit from the put option will be 200 – 28 = <strong>+172</strong></p>\n<p>We can further deduct for the premium paid for call option i.e. 32 from the profits of Put option and arrive at the overall profitability i.e. 172 – 32 = <strong>+140</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Market expires at 7640 (lower breakeven)</strong></p>\n<p>At 7640, the 7700 put option will have an intrinsic value of 60. The put option’s intrinsic value offsets the combined premium paid towards both the call and put option i.e. 32+28 = 60. Hence at 7640, the strangle neither makes money nor losses money.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Market expires at 7700 (at PE strike)</strong></p>\n<p>At 7700, both the call and put options would expire worthless, hence we would lose the entire premium paid i.e. 32 + 28 = 60. Do note, this also happens to be the maximum loss the strategy would suffer.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 4 – Market expires at 7900, 8100 (ATM and CE strike respectively)</strong></p>\n<p>Both the options expire worthless at 7900 and 8100. Hence we would lose the entire premium paid i.e. 60.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenarios 5 – Market expires at 8160 (upper breakeven)</strong></p>\n<p>At 8160, the 8100 Call option has an intrinsic value of 60, the gains in the call option would offset the loss incurred against the premium paid towards the call and put options.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenarios 6 – Market expires at 8300 (much higher than the CE strike)</strong></p>\n<p>Clearly at 8300, the 8100 call option would have an intrinsic value of 200 points; therefore the option would make 200 points. After adjusting for the combined premium paid of 60 points, we would be left with 140 points profit. Notice the symmetry of payoff above the upper and below the lower breakeven points.</p>\n<p>Here is a table which contains various other market expiry scenarios and the eventual payoff at these expiry levels –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-1_payoff-table.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_payoff table\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3255\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"340\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-1_payoff-table.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-1_payoff-table.png 944w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-1_payoff-table-300x127.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-1_payoff-table-768x326.png 768w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>We can plot the strategy payoff to visualize the payoff diagram of the strangle –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-2_graph.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3256\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"290\" sizes=\"(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-2_graph.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-2_graph.png 483w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-2_graph-300x180.png 300w\" width=\"483\"/></a></p>\n<p>We can generalize a few things about the ‘Strangle’ –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The maximum loss is restricted to the net premium paid</li>\n<li>The loss would be maximum between the two strike prices</li>\n<li>Upper Breakeven point = CE strike + net premium paid</li>\n<li>Lower Breakeven point = PE strike – net premium paid</li>\n<li>Profit potentially is unlimited</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So as long as the market moves (irrespective of the direction) the profits are expected to follow.</p>\n<h2>12.3 – Delta and Vega</h2>\n<p>Both straddles and strangles are similar strategies, therefore the Greeks have a similar effect on strangle and straddles.</p>\n<p>Since we are dealing with OTM options (remember we chose strikes that are equidistant from ATM), the delta of both CE and PE would be around 0.3, or lesser. We could add the deltas of each option and get a sense of how the overall position deltas behave.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>7700 PE Delta @ – 0.3</li>\n<li>8100 CE Delta @ + 0.3</li>\n<li>Combined delta would be -0.3 + 0.3 = 0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, I’ve just assumed 0.3 for both the options for convenience; however both the deltas could be slightly different, hence we could not be delta neutral in a strict sense. But then the deltas will certainly not be too high such that it renders a directional bias on the strategy. Anyway, the combined delta indicates that the strategy is directional neutral.</p>\n<p>The volatility has similar effect on both straddles and strangles. I’d suggest you refer <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-long-straddle/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Chapter 10, section 10.3</strong></a> to get a sense of how the volatility impacts the strangles.</p>\n<p>To summarize the effect of Greeks on strangles –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The volatility should be relatively low at the time of strategy execution</li>\n<li>The volatility should increase during the holding period of the strategy</li>\n<li>The market should make a large move – the direction of the move does not matter</li>\n<li>The expected large move is time bound, should happen quickly – well within the expiry</li>\n<li>Long strangle is to be setup around major events, and the outcome of these events have to be drastically different from the general market expectation</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I suppose you understand why long strangles have to be set up around major market events; we have discussed this point earlier as well. If you are confused, I’d request you to read Chapter 10.</p>\n<h2>12.4 – Short Strangle</h2>\n<p>The execution of a short strangle is the exact opposite of the long strangle. One needs to sell OTM Call and Put options which are equidistant from the ATM strike. In fact you would short the ‘strangle’ for the exact opposite reasons as to why you go long strangle. I will skip discussing the different expiry scenarios as I assume you are fairly comfortable with establishing the payoff by now.</p>\n<p>I’ve used the same strikes (the one used in long strangle example) for the short strangle example. Instead of buying these options, you would sell these OTM options to set up a short strangle. Here is the payoff table of the short strangle –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-3_payoff.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_payoff\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3257\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"340\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-3_payoff.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-3_payoff.png 944w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-3_payoff-300x127.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-3_payoff-768x326.png 768w\" width=\"800\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can notice, the strategy results in a loss as and when the market moves in any particular direction. However the strategy remains profitable between the lower and upper breakeven points. Recall –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upper breakeven point is at 8160</li>\n<li>Lower breakeven point is at 7640</li>\n<li>Max profit is net premium received, which is 60 points</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words you get to take home 60 points as long as the market stays within 7640 and 8160. In my opinion this is a fantastic proposition. More often than not market stays within certain trading ranges and therefore the market presents such beautiful trading opportunities.</p>\n<p>So here is something for you to think about – identify stocks which are in a trading range, typically stocks in a trading range form double/triple tops and bottom. Setup the ‘strangle’ by writing strikes which are outside the upper and lower range. When you write strangles in this backdrop make sure you watch closely for breakouts or breakdowns.</p>\n<p>I remember setting up this trade over and over again in Reliance couple of years ago – Reliance was stuck between 850 and 1000 for the longest time.</p>\n<p>Anyway, here is the payoff graph of the short strangle –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-4_graph.png\"><img alt=\"Image 4_graph\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3258\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"290\" sizes=\"(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-4_graph.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-4_graph.png 483w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Image-4_graph-300x180.png 300w\" width=\"483\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can notice –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The payoff of the short strangle looks exactly opposite of the long strangle</li>\n<li>The profits are restricted to the extent of the net premium received</li>\n<li>The profits are maximum as long as the stock stays within the two strike prices</li>\n<li>The losses are potentially unlimited</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The breakeven point calculation is the same as the breakeven points of a long strangle, which we have discussed earlier.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The strangle is an improvisation over the straddle, the improvisation helps in the strategy cost reduction</li>\n<li>Strangles are delta neutral and is insulated against any directional risk</li>\n<li>To set up a long strangle one needs to buy OTM Call and Put option</li>\n<li>The maximum loss in a long strangle is restricted to the extent of the premium received</li>\n<li>The profit potential is virtually unlimited in the long strangle</li>\n<li>The short strangle is the exact opposite of the long strangle.

Option Pain, or sometimes referred to as ‘Max Pain’ has a significant fan following and probably an equal number of people who despise it. I’ll be honest; I’ve been in both camps! In the initial days of following Option Pain, I was never able to make money consistently. However, overtime I found methods to improvise on this theory to suit my own risk appetite, and that yielded a decent result. Later in the chapter I will discuss this as well.</p>\n<p>Anyway, now this is my attempt to present you the Option Pain theory and talk to you about what I like and what I don’t about Max Pain. You can take cues from this chapter and decide for yourself which camp you want to be in.</p>\n<p>Option Pain theory requires you to be familiar with the concept of <strong><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/open-interest/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">‘Open Interest’</a><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/open-interest/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">.</a></strong></p>\n<p>So, let’s get started.</p>\n<h2>13.2 – Max Pain Theory</h2>\n<p>The origins of Option Pain dates back to 2004. So, in a sense, this is still a very young theory. As far as I know there are no academic/scholastic papers on it, which makes one wonder why the academia has ignored this concept.</p>\n<p>The theory of options pain stems as a corollary to the belief – “90% of the options expire worthless, hence option writers/sellers tend to make money more often, more consistently than the option buyers”.</p>\n<p>Now if this statement is true, then we can make a bunch of logical deductions –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At any point only one party can make money i.e either the option buyers or option sellers, but not both. From the above statement, it is clear that the sellers are the ones making money.</li>\n<li>If option sellers tend to make maximum money, then it also means that the price of the option on expiry day should be driven to a point where it would cause least amount of loss to option writers.</li>\n<li>If point 2 is true, then it further implies that option prices can be manipulated, at least on the day of expiry.</li>\n<li>If point 3 is true, then it further implies that there exists a group of traders who can manipulate the option prices, at least on the day of expiry.</li>\n<li>If such a group exists then it must be the option writers/sellers since it is believed that they are the ones who make maximum money/consistently make money trading options.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now considering all the above points, there must exist a single price point at which, if the market expires, then it would cause least amount of pain to the option writers (or cause maximum amount of pain to option buyers).</p>\n<p>If one can identify this price point, then it’s most likely that this is the point at which markets will expire. The ‘Option Pain’ theory does just this – identify the price at which the market is likely to expire considering least amount of pain is caused to option writers.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"M6-Ch13-Cartoon\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3616\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"400\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/M6-Ch13-Cartoon.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/M6-Ch13-Cartoon.png 600w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/M6-Ch13-Cartoon-300x200.png 300w\" width=\"600\"/></p>\n<p>Here is how optionspain.com formally defines Option Pain – “<em>In the options market, wealth transfer between option buyers and sellers is a zero sum game. On option expiration days, the underlying stock price often moves toward a point that brings maximum loss to option buyers. This specific price, calculated based on all outstanding options in the markets, is called Option Pain. Option Pain is a proxy for the stock price manipulation target by the option selling group</em>”.</p>\n<h2>13.3 – Max Pain Calculation</h2>\n<p>Here is a step by step guide to calculate the Max Pain value. At this stage, you may find this a bit confusing, but I recommend you read through it all the same. Things ill get clearer once we take up an example –</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong> – List down the various strikes on the exchange and note down the open interest of both calls and puts for these strikes.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong> – For each of the strike price that you have noted, assume that the market expires at that strike.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong> – Calculate how much money is lost by option writers (both call option and put option writers) assuming the market expires as per the assumption in step 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong> – Add up the money lost by call and put option writers.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong> – Identify the strike at which the money lost by option writers is least.</p>\n<p>This level, at which least amount of money is lost by option writers is the point at which maximum pain is caused to option buyers. Therefore this is the price at which the market is most likely to expire.</p>\n<p>Let us take up a very simple example to understand this. For the sake of this example, I’ll assume there are only 3 Nifty strikes available in the market. I have made a note of the open interest for both call and put options for the respective strike.</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Strike</th>\n<th>Call Option OI</th>\n<th>Put option OI</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>7700</td>\n<td>1823400</td>\n<td>5783025</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7800</td>\n<td>3448575</td>\n<td>4864125</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7900</td>\n<td>5367450</td>\n<td>2559375</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1 – Assume markets expires at 7700</strong></p>\n<p>Remember when you write a <strong>Call</strong> option, you will lose money only if the market moves above the strike. Likewise, when you write a <strong>Put</strong> option you will lose money only when the market moves below the strike price.</p>\n<p>Therefore if the market expires at 7700, none of the call option writers will lose money. Which means call option writers of 7700, 7800, and 7900 strikes will retain the premiums received.</p>\n<p>However, the put option writers will be in trouble. Let’s start with the 7900 PE writers –</p>\n<p>At 7700 expiry, 7900 PE writers would lose 200 points. Since the OI is 2559375, the Rupee value of loss would be –</p>\n<p>= 200 * 2559375 = Rs.5,11,875,000/-</p>\n<p>7800 PE writers would lose 100 points, the Rupee value would be</p>\n<p>= 100 * 4864125 = Rs.4,864,125,000/-</p>\n<p>7700 PE writers will not lose any money.</p>\n<p>So the combined money lost by option writers if the markets expire at 7700 would be –</p>\n<p>Total money lost by Call Option writers + Total money lost by Put Option writers</p>\n<p>= 0 + Rs.511875000 + 4,864125000 = <strong>Rs.9,98,287,500</strong>/-</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that total money lost by Call Option writers = money lost by 7700 CE writer + money lost by 7800 CE + money lost by 7900 CE</p>\n<p>Likewise the Total money lost by Put Option writers = money lost by 7700 PE writer + money lost by 7800 PE + money lost by 7900 PE</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2 – Assume markets expires at 7800 </strong></p>\n<p>At 7800, the following call option writers would lose money –</p>\n<p>7700 CE writers would lose 100 points, multiplying with its Open Interest we get the Rupee value of the loss.</p>\n<p>100*1823400 = Rs.1,82,340,000/-</p>\n<p>Both 7800 CE and 7900 CE seller would not lose money.</p>\n<p>The 7700 and 7800 PE seller wouldn’t lose money</p>\n<p>The 7900 PE would lose 100 points, multiplying with the Open Interest, we get the Rupee value of the loss.</p>\n<p>100*2559375 = Rs.2,55,937,500/-</p>\n<p>So the combined loss for Options writers when market expires at 7800 would be –</p>\n<p>= 182340000 + 255937500</p>\n<p>= <strong>Rs.4,38,277,500/-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 3 – Assume markets expires at 7900</strong></p>\n<p>At 7900, the following call option writers would lose money –</p>\n<p>7700 CE writer would lose 200 points, the Rupee value of this loss would be –</p>\n<p>200 *1823400 = Rs.3,646,800,000/-</p>\n<p>7800 CE writer would lose 100 points, the Rupee value of this loss would be –</p>\n<p>100*3448575 = Rs.3,44,857,500/-</p>\n<p>7900 CE writers would retain the premiums received.</p>\n<p>Since market expires at 7900, all the put option writers would retain the premiums received.</p>\n<p>So therefore the combined loss of option writers would be –</p>\n<p>= 3646800000 + 344857500 = <strong>Rs. 7,095,375,000/-</strong></p>\n<p>So at this stage, we have calculated the total Rupee value loss for option writers at every possible expiry level. Let me tabulated the same for you –</p>\n<table class=\"tableizer-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"tableizer-firstrow\">\n<th>Strike</th>\n<th>Call Option OI</th>\n<th>Put option OI</th>\n<th>Loss value of calls</th>\n<th>Loss value of Puts</th>\n<th>Total loss</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>7700</td>\n<td>1823400</td>\n<td>5783025</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>998287500</td>\n<td>998287500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7800</td>\n<td>3448575</td>\n<td>4864125</td>\n<td>182340000</td>\n<td>255937500</td>\n<td><span style=\"background-color: yellow;\">438277500</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7900</td>\n<td>5367450</td>\n<td>2559375</td>\n<td>7095375000</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>7095375000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now that we have identified the combined loss the option writers would experience at various expiry level, we can easily identify the point at which the market is likely to expire.</p>\n<p>As per the option pain theory, the market will expire at such a point where there is least amount of pain (read it as least amount of loss) to Option <strong>sellers</strong>.</p>\n<p>Clearly, from the table above, this point happens to be 7800, where the combined loss is around <strong style=\"background-color: yellow;\">438277500</strong> or about 43.82 Crores, which is much lesser compared to the combined loss at 7700 and 7900.</p>\n<p>The calculation is as simple as that. However, I’ve used only 3 strikes in the example for simplicity. But in reality there are many strikes for a given underlying, especially Nifty. Calculations become a bit cumbersome and confusing, hence one would have to resort to a tool like excel.</p>\n<p>I’ve calculated the option pain value as of today (10<sup>th</sup> May 2016) on excel, have a look at the image –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image-1_comuputation.png\"><img alt=\"Image 1_comuputation\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3613\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"361\" sizes=\"(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image-1_comuputation.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image-1_comuputation.png 513w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image-1_comuputation-300x211.png 300w\" width=\"513\"/></a></p>\n<p>For all the available strikes, we assume market would expire at that point and then compute the Rupee value of the loss for CE and PE option writers. This value is shown in the last column titled “Total Value”.  Once you calculate the total value, we simply have to identify the point at which the least amount of money is lost by the option writer. You can identify this by plotting the ‘bar graph’ of the total value. The bar graph would look like this –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image-2_max-pain.png\"><img alt=\"Image 2_max pain\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3614\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"291\" sizes=\"(max-width: 483px) 100vw, 483px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image-2_max-pain.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image-2_max-pain.png 483w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image-2_max-pain-300x181.png 300w\" width=\"483\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, the 7800 strike is the point at which option writers would lose the least amount of money, so as per the option pain theory, 7800 is where the market is likely to expire for the May series.</p>\n<p>Now that you have established the expiry level, how can you use this information? Well, there are multiple ways you can use this information.</p>\n<p>Most traders use this max pain level to identity the strikes which they can write. In this case, since 7800 is the expected expiry level, one can choose to write call options above 7800 or put options below 7800 and collect all the premiums.</p>\n<p><strong>13.4 – A Few Modifications</strong></p>\n<p>In the initial days, I was very eager to learn about Option Pain. Everything about it made absolute sense. I remember crunching numbers, identifying the expiry level, and writing options to glory. But shockingly the market would expire at some other point leaving me booking a loss and I wondering if I was wrong with my calculations or if the entire theory is flawed!</p>\n<p>So I eventually improvised on the classic option pain theory to suit my risk appetite. Here is what I did –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The OI values change every day. This means the option pain could suggest 7800 as the expiry level on 10<sup>th</sup> of May and may very well suggest 8000 on 20<sup>th</sup> of May. I froze on a particular day of the month to run this computation. I preferred doing this when there were 15 days to expiry.</li>\n<li>I identified the expiry value as per the regular option pain method.</li>\n<li>I would add a 5% ‘safety buffer’. So at 15 days to expiry, the theory suggest 7800 as expiry, then I’d add a 5% safety buffer. This would make the expiry value as 7800 + 5% of 7800 = 8190 or 8200 strike.</li>\n<li>I would expect the market to expire at any point between 7800 to 8200.</li>\n<li>I would set up strategies keeping this expiry range in mind, my most favorite being to write call options beyond 8200.</li>\n<li>I would avoid writing Put option for this simple belief – panic spreads faster than greed. This means markets can fall faster than it can go up.</li>\n<li>I would hold the options sold up to expiry, and would usually avoid averaging during this period.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The results were much better when I followed this method. Unfortunately, I never tabulated the results, hence I cannot quantify my gains. However if you come from a programming background, you can easily back test this logic and share the results with the rest of community here. Anyway, at a much later stage I realized the 5% buffer was essentially taking to strikes which were approximately 1.5 to 2% standard deviations away, which meant the probability of markets moving beyond the expected expiry level was about 34%.</p>\n<p>If you are not sure what this means, I’d suggest you read this chapter on <strong><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/volatility-normal-distribution/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">standard deviation and distribution of returns</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>You can <a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Option-Max-Pain.xlsx\"><strong>download</strong></a> the Option Pain computation excel.</p>\n<p><strong>13.5 – The Put Call Ratio</strong></p>\n<p>The Put Call Ratio is a fairly simple ratio to calculate. The ratio helps us identify extreme bullishness or bearishness in the market. PCR is usually considered a contrarian indicator. Meaning, if the PCR indicates extreme bearishness, then we expect the market to reverse, hence the trader turns bullish. Likewise if PCR indicates extreme bullishness, then traders expect markets to reverse and decline.</p>\n<p>To calculate PCR, all one needs to do is divide the total open interest of Puts by the total open interest of the Calls. The resulting value usually varies in and around one. Have a look at the image below –</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image-3_PCR.png\"><img alt=\"Image 3_PCR\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3615\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"382\" sizes=\"(max-width: 192px) 100vw, 192px\" src=\"http://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image-3_PCR.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image-3_PCR.png 192w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Image-3_PCR-151x300.png 151w\" width=\"192\"/></a></p>\n<p>As on 10<sup>th</sup> May, the total OI of both Calls and Puts has been calculated. Dividing the Put OI by Call OI gives us the PCR ratio –</p>\n<p>37016925 / 42874200 <strong>= 0.863385</strong></p>\n<p>The interpretation is as follows –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the PCR value is above 1, say 1.3 – then it suggests that there are more Puts being bought compared to Calls. This suggests that the markets have turned extremely bearish, and therefore sort of oversold. One can look for reversals and expect the markets to go up.</li>\n<li>Low PCR values such as 0.5 and below indicates that there are more calls being bought compared to puts. This suggests that the markets have turned extremely bullish, and therefore sort of overbought. One can look for reversals and expect the markets to go down.</li>\n<li>All values between 0.5 and 1 can be attributed to regular trading activity and can be ignored.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Needless to say, this is a generic approach to PCR. What would really make sense is to historically plot the daily PCR values for say 1 or 2 years and identify these extreme values. For example for Nifty value such as 1.3 can indicate extreme bearishness, but for say Infy something like 1.2 could be extreme bearishness. So you need to be clear about this, hence back testing helps.</p>\n<p>You may wonder why the PCR is used as a contrarian indicator. Well, the explanation to this is rather tricky, but the general opinion is this – if the traders are bearish/bullish, then most of them have already taken their respective position (hence a high/low PCR) and therefore there aren’t many other players who can come in and drive the positions in the desired direction. Hence the position will eventually be squared off which would drive the stock/index in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p>So that’s PCR for you. You may come across many variants of this – some prefer to take the total traded value instead of OI, some even prefer to take the volumes. But I personally don’t think it is required to over-think PCR.</p>\n<h2>13.6 – Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>And with this, I’d like to end this module on Options, which has spread across 2 modules and 36 chapters!</p>\n<p>We have discussed close to 15 different option strategies in this module, which I personally think is more than sufficient for retail traders to trade options professionally. Yes, going forward you will encounter many fancy option strategies, perhaps your friend will suggest a fancy option strategy and show off the technicalities of the strategy, but do remember – ‘fancy’ does not really translate to profit. Some of the best strategies are simple , elegant and easy to implement.</p>\n<p>The content we have presented in both, Module 5 and Module 6, is written with an intention of giving you a clear picture on options trading – what is possible to be achieve with options trading and what is not possible. We have thought through and discussed what is required and what isn’t. Frankly these two modules are more than sufficient to answer most of your concerns/doubts related to options.</p>\n<p>So please do take some time to read through the contents here, at your own pace, and I’m certain you will you will start trading options the way it is supposed to be done.</p>\n<p>Finally, I hope you will enjoy reading this as much as I enjoyed writing this for you.</p>\n<p>Good luck and stay profitable!</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Key takeaways from this chapter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Option Pain theory assumes that the option writers tend to make more money consistently compared to option buyers.</li>\n<li>Option pain assumes that option writers can influence the price of options on the day of expiry.</li>\n<li>One can use the theory of option pain to identify the price at which the stock/index is likely to expiry.</li>\n<li>The strike at which the option writers would experience least amount of loss is the strike at which the stock/index likely to expire.</li>\n<li>The PCR is calculated by dividing the total open interest of Puts by the total open interest of the Calls.</li>\n<li>The PCR is considered as a contrarian indicator.</li>\n<li>Generally a PCR value of over 1.3 is considered bearish and a PCR value of less than 0.5 is considered bullish.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",

Well, we have discussed this several times in this module, but for the sake of completeness of this chapter, we will quickly discuss this again.</p>\n<p>Assume you are riding a bike at 75Kms per hour, without wearing a helmet. Suddenly you come across a pothole, you slam the breaks to cut speed, but it’s too late, you crash and fall.  What is the probability of injuring your head? Quite high given the fact that you are not wearing a helmet.</p>\n<p>Now imagine the same situation, but instead of being carefree, you decide to wear a helmet. Given the crash, what is the probability of injuring your head? Low probability, right? Because the helmet protects you from an injury.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/M6-C14.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8170\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" height=\"306\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/M6-C14-300x200.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/M6-C14-300x200.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/M6-C14.png 600w\" width=\"460\"/></a></p>\n<p>The helmet acts as a hedge against a potential disaster.</p>\n<p>In the same way, a naked futures or options position in the market is like riding a bike without wearing a helmet. The risk of market-moving against your position, causing capital erosion is high.</p>\n<p>However, if you hedge your position, then the risk of losing capital reduces drastically.</p>\n<p>Now, think about this – if your capital loss is minimal, then it implies that the risk for your broker is also minimum right? Now, if the risk for the broker reduces, it also means the risk for the exchange reduces.</p>\n<p>So what does this mean to you as a trader?</p>\n<p>Remember, the critical margin dynamics – the lesser the risk you carry, the lower the margin requirement. Higher the risk, higher the margin requirement.</p>\n<p>Therefore, this means whenever you initiate a hedged strategy, the margins blocked by your broker is less compared to the margin required for a naked position.</p>\n<p>In essence, NSE has proposed the same in the new margin framework.</p>\n<p>You can check this <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CLeaZQIOiYJD40edLyAqiqxnISnE68yV/view\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">presentation by NSE for more details. </a></p>\n<p>The presentation is quite technical; you do not have to crack your head to understand this unless you really want to.</p>\n<p>From a trader’s point of view, there are three key takeaways from the new margin policy; all the three highlighted in 1 slide of this presentation, here is a snapshot –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-1_nse.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8161\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"288\" sizes=\"(max-width: 513px) 100vw, 513px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-1_nse-300x168.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-1_nse-300x168.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-1_nse-768x431.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-1_nse.png 994w\" width=\"513\"/></a></p>\n<p>Starting from the top –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Portfolio 1 – Margins have increased for naked unhedged positions to 18.5% from the current 16.7%.</li>\n<li>Portfolio 2 – 70% reduction in margins for market-neutral positions</li>\n<li>Portfolio 3 – 80% reduction in margins for spread positions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What does this mean to you as an options trader?</p>\n<p>Well, some of the useful strategies, which looked great on paper but were prohibitive to implement due to excessive margin requirement, now look enticing.</p>\n<p>A trick question for you here – why do you think the margin reduction is higher for spread position compared to a neutral market position?.</p>\n<p>Do think about it and post your response in the comment section.</p>\n<p>So given this, I want to discuss one more options strategy in this module, I had not discussed it earlier since the margin requirement was very high, but now, it’s no longer the case.</p>\n<h2><strong>14.2 – Iron Condor</strong></h2>\n<p>The iron condor is a four-legged option setup. The iron condor is an improvisation over the short strangle.</p>\n<p>Have a look at this –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-2_ss.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8162\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"195\" sizes=\"(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-2_ss-300x115.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-2_ss-300x115.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-2_ss-768x294.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-2_ss.png 924w\" width=\"508\"/></a></p>\n<p>I’ve taken this snapshot from <a href=\"https://web.sensibull.com/option-strategy-builder\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sensibull’s Options Strategy Builder</a>. As you can see, Nifty is at 9972.9, and I’m trying to set up a short strangle by shorting OTM calls and puts –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>9800 Put at 165.25</li>\n<li>10100 Call at 145.25</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since both the options are written/sold, I get to collect a total premium of 164.25+145.25 = 309.5.</p>\n<p>For those of you not familiar with the strangles, I’d suggest you read through <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-long-short-strangle/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this chapter</a>.</p>\n<p>The pay off for this short strangle set up is as follows –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-3_ssp.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8163\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"248\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-3_ssp-300x151.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-3_ssp-300x151.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-3_ssp-768x386.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-3_ssp.png 901w\" width=\"492\"/></a></p>\n<p>I love this strategy because it lets me retain the premium as long as Nifty stays within a range, which most often it does. Besides, this is also a great way to trade volatility. Whenever you think the volatility has shot up (usually it does around big market events) and therefore the option premiums, then you’d want to be an options seller and pocket the high premiums. Short strangles is perfect for such trades.</p>\n<p>In a short strangle, since you sell/write options, it results in a net premium credit. In this case, you get a premium of Rs.23,288/-.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-4_breakeven.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8164\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"116\" sizes=\"(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-4_breakeven-300x65.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-4_breakeven-300x65.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-4_breakeven-768x165.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-4_breakeven.png 860w\" width=\"537\"/></a></p>\n<p>The only issue with short strangles is the exposed ends. The strategy bleeds if the underlying asset moves in either direction.</p>\n<p>For example, this particular short strangle has a range of safety between 9490 and 10411.</p>\n<p>I agree this is a wide enough range, but markets have taught that it can make crazy moves within a short period. Most recent being the COVID-19 crash in early 2020 followed by quick recovery from the lows.</p>\n<p>If you are caught with such a rapid market move, the potential loss can be colossal and can wipe your account clean. Now, because the possible loss is unlimited, this means the risk to you and the broker is quite high. Eventually, this translates to <a href=\"https://zerodha.com/margin-calculator/SPAN/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">higher margins</a> as well –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-5_mar.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8165\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"273\" sizes=\"(max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-5_mar-300x258.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-5_mar-300x258.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-5_mar.png 420w\" width=\"318\"/></a></p>\n<p>The margin to set up a short strangle is nearly 1.45L, which is quite prohibitive for many traders.</p>\n<p>However, this does not mean that you have to say goodbye to a short strangle. You can improvise on the short strangle and set up an iron condor, which in my opinion is a far better strategy.</p>\n<p>An iron condor improvises a short strangle by plugging in the open ends. Think of an iron condor in 3 parts –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Part 1 – Set up a short strangle by selling a slightly OTM Call and Put option</li>\n<li>Part 2 – Buy a further OTM Call to protect the short call against a massive market rally</li>\n<li>Part 3 – Buy a further OTM Put to protect the short Put against a massive market decline</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This makes an iron condor a four-leg option strategy. Let us see how this looks –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Part 1 – Sell 9800 PE at 165.25 and sell a 10100CE at 145.25, collect a premium of 310.5 or Rs.23,288/-.</li>\n<li>Part 2 – Buy 10300 CE at 77 to protect the short 10100 CE</li>\n<li>Part 3 – Buy 9600 PE at 105.05 to protect the short 9800 PE</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The trade setup looks like this –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-6_ic.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8166\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"165\" sizes=\"(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-6_ic-300x103.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-6_ic-300x103.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-6_ic-768x264.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-6_ic.png 797w\" width=\"481\"/></a></p>\n<p>If you think about this, the short option premium collected finances the long option positions.</p>\n<p>Since you buy two options to protect against two short options, the profit potential reduces to a certain extent –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-7_profit.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8167\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"126\" sizes=\"(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-7_profit-300x65.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-7_profit-300x65.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-7_profit-768x167.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-7_profit.png 857w\" width=\"582\"/></a></p>\n<p>As you can see, the max profit is now Rs.9,634/-, but the reduced profit comes with reduced stress 🙂</p>\n<p>The max loss is no longer unlimited but restricted to Rs.5,366, which in my opinion is awesome because I now have visibility on risk and it is not open-ended.</p>\n<p>The profit is restricted, as long as Nifty stays within a range, in this case between 9672 and 10228. Notice, the range has shrunk compared to the short strangle.</p>\n<p>The payoff of an iron condor looks like this –</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-8_icpf.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8168\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"229\" sizes=\"(max-width: 458px) 100vw, 458px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-8_icpf-300x150.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-8_icpf-300x150.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-8_icpf-768x385.png 768w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-8_icpf.png 900w\" width=\"458\"/></a></p>\n<p>Now, what do you think about the risk? The risk here is completely defined. You have clear visibility on the worst-case scenario. So what does it mean to you as a trader, and what does it mean to the broker?</p>\n<p>You guessed it right since the risk is defined, the margins are lesser.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-9_mar.png\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8169\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"327\" sizes=\"(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px\" src=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-9_mar-300x261.png\" srcset=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-9_mar-300x261.png 300w, https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Image-9_mar.png 426w\" width=\"377\"/></a></p>\n<p>This is where the new margin framework of NSE comes into play. An iron condor requires you to pay an upfront margin of only Rs.44,303/-, contrast this with the short strangle’s margin requirement of Rs.1.45L.</p>\n<p>Besides, before the new margin framework, executing an iron condor was not very viable for a retail trader. For these strikes and premiums, the margin requirement for an Iron Condor was roughly in the range of 2 to 2.2L.</p>\n<h2><strong>14.3 – Max P&amp;L </strong></h2>\n<p>There are a few important things you need to remember while executing an iron condor –</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The PE and CE that you buy should have even strike distribution from the sold strike. For example, here we have sold 9800 PE and 10,100 CE. We have protected the sold strikes by going long on 9600 PE and 10,300 CE. The difference between 9800 PE and 9600 PE is 200 and 10,100 CE and 10,300 CE is 200. The spread should be even. I cannot protect 9800 PE by buying 9700 PE (difference of 100) and then protect 10,100 CE with 10,300 CE (difference of 200).</li>\n<li>The Max loss occurs when the market moves either above long CE i.e. 10,300 CE or moves below long PE i.e. 9,600PE</li>\n<li><strong>Spread</strong> = 200 i.e. the difference between the sold strike and its protective strike.</li>\n<li><strong>Max Profit</strong> = Net premium received. In this case, it is 128.45 (9634/75)</li>\n<li><strong>Max loss</strong> = Spread – Net premium received. In this case, it is 200 – 128.45 = 71.54.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’d suggest you look at the excel sheet at the end of this chapter for detail working of this. Please note, I have updated the excel sheet 2 days after I wrote this chapter, hence the values are different.</p>\n<h2><strong>14.4 – ROI and Logistics </strong></h2>\n<p>By setting up a short strangle, you receive a premium of Rs.23,288/- and for the iron condor, the premium receivable is Rs.9,643/-. Agreed, in terms of absolute Rupees, the iron condor offers a far lesser premium inflow. But when you measure this against the margin requirement, the ROI flips in favour of the Iron condor.</p>\n<p>Short strangle requires a margin of Rs.1,45,090/-. Therefore the ROI is –</p>\n<p>23,288/1,45,090</p>\n<p>=16%.</p>\n<p>The margin requirement for iron condor is Rs.44,303/-. Therefore the ROI is –</p>\n<p>9,643/44,303</p>\n<p>= 21%</p>\n<p>As a trader, you need to think in terms of ROI and not absolute numbers, and the margin benefit makes a significant difference here.</p>\n<p>The sequence of trade execution makes a big difference here. If you are considering an iron condor, then here is the trade sequence –</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy the far OTM call option</li>\n<li>Sell the OTM Call option</li>\n<li>Buy the far OTM PUT</li>\n<li>Sell the OTM PUT option</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The point here is that you need to have a long position first before initiating the short position.</p>\n<p>Why? Because short option position is a margin guzzler, so when you have a long position, the system knows the risk is contained and hence will ask you for lesser margins for the short position.</p>\n<p>Please note, I’ve only considered the margin blocked for the ROI calculation, I’ve not considered the money paid to buy the options and the money received when you write an option.</p>\n<p>So traders, as a next step, I’d urge you to select different strikes for the long positions and see what happens to the premium receivable, breakeven points, and the max loss.</p>\n<p>Do post your observation and queries below.</p>\n<h3><strong>Key takeaways from this chapter</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>NSE’s new margin framework reduces the margin requirement for market neutral and hedged strategies</li>\n<li>While the short strangle is an excellent strategy, it has open ends with potentially unlimited losses</li>\n<li>The iron condor is an improvisation over the short strangle</li>\n<li>In an iron condor, the long OTM calls and puts protect the open ends of the  short strangle</li>\n<li>Margin required for an iron condor is far lesser compared to a short strangle</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"button\" href=\"https://zerodha.com/varsity/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/C14_Iron-Condor.xlsx\">Download Iron Condor Excel Sheet</a></p>\n<div class=\"clear\"> </div>\n</div>",
